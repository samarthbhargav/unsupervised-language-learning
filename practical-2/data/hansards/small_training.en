Mr. Bob Speller : 
Mr. Odina Desrochers 
we already know that the legislation will have to be changed or amended accordingly . 
Mr. Speaker , I know the farmers in the affected areas will be pleased with the announcement the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food made in the House today . 
it must be remembered that the MIR station was expected to last about five years , but was in service for over ten . 
i was trying to encourage this government to think about it . 
he will have to infer from the facts his own sense . 
they routinely occur in many parts of the world today . 
there are a number of options to correct the decision made by the Province of Ontario regarding bilingualism in the national capital . 
that Bill C - 9 , in Clause 27 , be amended by replacing lines 7 and 8 on page 10 with the following : 
witnesses have to be sponsored by a party , and there is a limit on the number of individuals or groups who can come and testify here . 
they should be listed clearly , definitively and separately from everyone else . 
this is one thing that limits the influence of big money . 
how will this help all Canadians including those from Windsor and Essex county ? 
as I said , the Bloc Quebecois supports the bill before us today , despite the fact it lacks clear direction and does not provide for consultations with the provinces and various stakeholders . 
on a systemic level , governance is an important contributing factor to a properly performing market and investment system which , in turn , has an important impact on the wealth creation process in the Canadian economy as a whole . 
the only official language of the parliament of the time was English . 
concerns on the siting and size parameters necessary to protect and conserve marine biological diversity in national marine conservation areas remain unanswered . 
that in my mind reflects on a very specific wish to make the question somewhat cloudy . 
Mr. Speaker , I am not trying to hide anything . 
as I said before , they were the words of a Mr. Rean Meyer , President of the Heraldry Society of Canada , British Columbia Yukon Branch . 
i have witnessed first hand the pain , discouragement and financial suffering of victims of hepatitis C in my riding . 
what I also said was that the Indian Act is silent on women ' s rights and it is an issue we will be dealing with . 
No. 
that did not come from the Reform Party . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron : 
they have the legal right to get married and to raise children . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
this bill is almost racist . 
the bill speaks to a contemporary , professional public service that we are fortunate to have here in Canada . 
the announcement made by the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services in December to build more homeless shelters was a start . 
that is the danger .

if the government has nothing to hide , why does the minister not table today the complete Scotia Rainbow file if she has one ? 
clearly , when someone breaks the law and commits a heinous crime , it has to be dealt with swiftly , in a meaningful way as stated in the act and in some cases severely . 
Mr. Derek Lee 
Mr. Speaker , I want to assure the member and all members in the House that voting is a fundamental right of our democracy .

he vowed to fight his own government tooth and nail on this bill . 
for once , Mr. Pierre Gravel was of the opinion that we were doing our work by creating a filibuster to stop Bill C - 82 in its tracks , because , among other things , the bill provided life sentences for impaired driving causing death . 
member after member of that party are defecting and resigning because they cannot tolerate the positions being taken .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
we did so in a spirit of co - operation , knowing that for young people across Canada we could bring the best from all areas including Quebec and do so in a very positive way . 
that fact goes to the very heart of our history , of our existence as a country . 
i was fascinated to hear about his research on hepatitis B , which was conducted in a Canadian institute at a very high level . 
i will be splitting my time .

she has listened to a wide range of views on the matter in order to come up with a solution to this problem . 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. parliamentary secretary , but time has run out . 
that is what we should have done , but I am afraid it will have to be done in another bill . 
i will be referring later to some very distinguished Canadians who believe that Bill C - 20 in no way infringes upon the rights of provincial legislatures to do as they wish in framing questions . 
she would hand out these cards . 
we have a quorum . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
we continue to do so . 
it is to limit competition on the ballot . 
my parents ' fight for custody was the scariest thing in the world and it made me realize that marriage is stupid and having kids is something I ' ll never ever do .

as the government moves into not only a new year but a new decade , a new century , and a new millennium , I would think it would want to do that too . 
Mr. Speaker , they have been cut already . 
the finance minister has done an extraordinary job in bringing us all together . 
i would like to emphasize a point made by my colleague , the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice , that corporate criminal liability is part of the larger goal of improving workplace safety .

Wednesday , December 8 , 1999 
i remember discussing that situation with Senators Forrestall and Roche in the Foreign Affairs Committee . 
Mr. George Proud : 
and it is important to recall that with the great waves of immigration , there has been , since the beginning , an underlying motif : the lost , the rejected , and those who dreamed of another life would come here and would make a contribution to the whole . 
the Speaker : 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) moved :

Mr. John Bryden

Ms. H é l è ne Alarie : 
the Brandeis Brief , named after the great Mr. Justice Brandeis , details social and economic evidence of the implications of court decisions including the practical consequences of those decisions . 
they are taking part this week in the Canada Sports Friendship Exchange Program with a team from Gatineau , Quebec . 
i will conclude by saying that there is no doubt that the federal government should withdraw immediately from the administration of criminal justice and leave it to the provinces . 
Mr. Speaker , on February 1 , CANDO sent the human resources minister an urgent e - mail about the missing money : " We are in jeopardy '' . 
motions Nos. 439 , 440 , 441 , 442 , 443 , 444 and 445

they urged the federal government to raise family allowances . 
a society that respects and honours its children has its fundamentals right . 
Mr. Speaker , as you know , if you have to take a lot of time standing , waiting for order , that uses up time which would otherwise go toward questions and answers . 
( division 396 ) 
this morning the minister said that if parliament does not settle the issue , the courts will . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
let us not kid ourselves . 
motion No. 9 
we are going backward , not forward . 
not only does the bill give enormous ministerial discretion , but the bill also fails to include certain agencies and crown corporations of the federal government in Schedule IV of the act . 
with the exception of the past two or three years during which people have begun to feel the impact of federal government policies , they have seen their incomes go up . 
we know that Canadian Airlines has recommended that the offer be accepted by its shareholders .

Mr. Speaker , as regards globalization , the Minister for International Trade said he was open to the idea of a WTO parliament to ensure greater transparency . 
the federal government also has a role as the primary funding agent of research and development as part of post - secondary education in Canada , which , if research funds are properly disbursed across the country , would help in regional development . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold 
i am sure you cannot remember back 100 years ago . 
my concern is that no one has given the countries covered by Bill S - 3 a systematic examination . 
what we want to do is start working as soon as possible on a long term solution by bringing people together . 
through its small business loans program , it has , since 1993 , and most recently in Alberta , given out 3,905 in loans worth $ 430 million . 
1,142 yes , they should have that right ; only 92 voted no . 
we can probably all remember a government which called a needless election at great expense to the taxpayer just because the governing party had the power to do so . 
in the case of the definition of the terms " children " or " vulnerable persons " , officials of the Department of the Solicitor General answered our concerns as follows : 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
this is where the human element of safety must also enter into the equation . 
senator Oliver : 
it is a process that does not require the consent of a number of the provinces across Canada that a constitutional amendment would entail . 
companies are asking for investment rules that would govern investment around the world . 
what does he mean by that ? 
therefore , the Acting Speaker acted rightfully . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik 
in fact , they even went on in the letter to encourage the Prime Minister to consider the use of the notwithstanding clause to send a clear message that Canada ' s charter of rights and freedoms would never again be used to defend sexual abuse of Canadian children . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the tourism industry in Quebec is guided by Tourisme Qu é bec , a department which directs government actions relating to tourism . 
UNESCO points out that war begins in our minds ; so , too , must the new idea begin in our minds : that peace is absolutely necessary in a technological age of mass destruction .

... the Minister of Justice , who is responsible for the application of the Extradition Act , may refuse to make a surrender order when the conduct in respect of which the request for extradition is made is the subject of criminal proceedings in Canada against that person . 
these two young people cannot be named because they were under the age of 18 and therefore apparently not responsible for any action they took .

it is truly pathetic . 
madam Speaker , my Conservative colleague mentioned the roots of criminality . 
it turns out that Transelec is not quite doing the job and the government has been worried about being on the hook ever since . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
think that , during the past 50 years , everything has been said . 
they benefit from improved information , lower transaction costs and thus lower prices , and larger choices which can include products tailored to individual requirements and instant delivery for intangible services and products in digital form . 
they are sick and tired of seeing people like Karla Homolka making deals and getting off easy . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to make it very clear to this member and to everyone that I deplore human smuggling . 
as well , Bill C - 20 allows parliament to determine , following the referendum on secession in a province , if a clear majority of the population of the province has clearly expressed a will to cease to be a part of Canada , and sets out the factors to be considered in making its determination . 
we all know the terrible impact of the reaction when they were essentially told to turn around and paddle their canoes back home , which they did , but they never gave up . 
they need to know where the government stands on the issue of the Marshall decision as it applies to Newfoundland . 
i have said it three times now .

motion No. 151 negatived 
members 
on this point I believe the member has a valid argument that perhaps a parliamentary committee should be struck to thoroughly investigate ways in which we can strengthen the protection that Canadians need in ensuring that their personal information remains just that , personal . 
i should like to make the answer as brief and direct as I can , but it may require more than a " yes " or a " no " . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
therefore I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House to transfer all the Reform motions which are not in the name of the hon. member for North Vancouver or the hon. member for Elk Island to be moved by the hon. member for North Vancouver and seconded by the hon. member for Elk Island .

we know that 52 % of Newfoundlanders voted in favour of joining confederation . 
Mr. Jason Kenney 
our goal is to make Canada the country of choice for researchers from around the world . 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member who just asked the question and his party were one of a number of people and parties that asked us a year ago to do something to assist producers so that the precipitous drop in incomes in 1998 in comparison to previous years could be assisted . 
as for the financial resources earmarked by the governments of Canada and Quebec to fight organized crime , they seem clearly inadequate . 
in many ways , the motto of " Be Prepared , " which Baden - Powell himself noted was founded on his own initials and means that " you are always to be in a state of readiness in mind and body to do your duty , " has been a hallmark of this distinguished senator who I have always been so proud for so many years to call a true friend . 
yet , Amnesty International and others were pointing out that political opponents were being inappropriately jailed and not receiving fair trials and treatment . 
one of the issues that was raised often and was strongly supported was the national child benefit , not to mention the appreciation of Canadians for the government modernizing the employment insurance program . 
we will do this again . 
and if there are similar laws in the other provinces , these objects must also be included in them .

when I spoke of infiltration , one of the useful tools in law enforcement is infiltration of criminal groups . 
the Standing Orders of the House are virtually silent on the subject of Members ' dress .

hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
that may be what it takes in order to save the family farm and make sure farmers do not have to sacrifice themselves until such time as we get the EU and the Americans in line on this . 
after that our children and our grandchildren who will replace us will find the full impact of the provisions of the treaty . 
we all thank the hon. member for that clarification . 
they do not necessarily understand exactly how they ended up in that situation , because those who made the cuts and reduced services are those who manage the programs , that is the provincial governments . 
your Committee which is authorized by section 88 of the Official Languages Act to review on a permanent basis the administration of the Act , any regulations and directives made under the Act and the reports of the Commissioner of Official Languages , the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Canadian Heritage , reports , pursuant to rule 104 , that the expenses incurred by the Committee during the First Session of the Thirty - sixth Parliament are as follows .

without property rights , no other rights are possible . 
it also does not make sense to build a facility from the ground up in relative isolation from major medical centres across the country . 
i would like to ask , who was approving these grants ? 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Immigration . 
in 1966 the difference between unemployment in the highest and lowest months was 46 % . 
the fact is that we do not even have the proper resources allocated right now in order to protect the stock . 
in those days property or income based qualifications effectively prevented large segments of the working population from voting . 
today , parliament is faced with a supreme court ruling , and it is always the same story . 
i am confident that the minister involved will welcome the constructive comments of the Auditor General , and I expect that he will take them into account and act accordingly . 
the account will be managed by an approved private sector fund manager selected by a committee representing the employees . 
Mr. Simpson went on to write : 
we have a number of concerns . 
it is regrettable in the extreme the federal government did not have the foresight to at least take under serious advisement the urgings of the Mi ' kmaq leadership to anticipate the outcome of the decision . 
last spring the government gave the Labour Minister a mandate to find a solution , and she was supposed to derive a strategy within a month . 
he also mentioned the Libman decision .

motion No. 13 to amend clause 7 ( 2 ) ( a ) broadens the type of offences that organizations can investigate using personal information without consent where they believe there has been a contravention of the law . 
i am demanding that the Government of Canada take concrete action in co - operation with provincial and territorial governments , towards the reduction of the federal excise tax , a uniform reduction of the road tax in Quebec and the restoring of a special monetary subsidy on the price of fuel oil for families that have used this product since December 1 , 1999 . It would be in force for four months . 
i would suggest that there is a number of groups that believe it is important to strengthen the legislation to make absolutely sure that health care , health information and the social area information is not being abused . 
it is something we cannot gloss over . 
it is also quite clear that the treaty will be subject to the constitution and the charter of rights and freedoms .

the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have assured the House that tax cuts will be part of this budget and future budgets . 
we recognize the importance of trying to find a balance between protecting the environment and encouraging economic development . 
there is also the law of silence governing all relationships in the underworld ; search warrants that are restrictive because of the courts interpretation of the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights ; small police budgets compared to resources available to criminal groups ; the difficulty to assert that , simply by associating with them , a person is really involved with other individuals for a criminal purpose , since organized crime is not considered a crime , and only individual actions are ; the banking secret of tax havens , which protects against the laundering of proceeds of crime . 
Mr. Speaker , how can Reform claim that 50 % plus one is sufficient when , as the Prime Minister has said , it is not enough to amend its constitution ? 
in 1944 , two more Canadian war ships were lost , and an estimated 91 people killed .

Mr. Speaker , at the outset I would ask the Chair to recognize that I will be splitting my time with my colleague from West Nova , who will be speaking to the issue of fisheries . 
if the Fisheries Committee examines the expenditures related to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans , that would also accommodate Senator Robichaud ' s request and will not interfere with what Senator Murray wants . 
having said that I have no doubt that I have brought Senator Kinsella small comfort in respect of his concerns about Bill C - 20 . However , with regard to this particular bill , his point has been well made and well taken . 
can the Minister of Transport assure us that the hope of acceptance for his proposal on which Onex ' s president is relying is not the direct result of personal guarantees received from certain members of the government since the beginning of this affair ? 
we have approximately 60,000 new cases every year .

from 1990 onward the negotiators conducted extensive consultations with the public and third parties .

madam Speaker , I have heard some interventions in my day but that one certainly took the cake . 
my department has made it a priority . 
under the present circumstances , the government and the members across should be able to help stimulate the flow of a little more money from the province , considering that their party is now sleeping with the NDP . 
this could be called taxation on automatic pilot . 
will the government abandon this dangerous bill ?

the Speaker : 
if a person asks a question , it is surely because that person wants to hear an answer . 
in that environment , I grew not only to respect Ron but to really like him . 
Mr. Speaker , during question period , I quoted from a National Assembly motion on the Young Offenders Act . 
however , when we see how little it recognizes the role of the provinces in this bill , which puts them on the same footing as all the other players , we know it does not want to recognize the crucial role provincial governments must play , namely to properly plan for the management and organization of health care services . 
yet , they have good attendance . 
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) : 
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House ? 
we have managed to achieve a balanced budget . 
this was the only section of the previous young offenders act that they would like to see changed .

the Canada - China human rights dialogue has allowed Canada access to Chinese agencies whose cooperation is essential to improving human rights practices in China . 
the hon. member touched on a number of the diverse elements behind the legislation , but I personally think the important part of the legislation is its enhanced access to what I would call adult measures . 
sadly , it is easy to develop a list of all those who have been victims of genocide .

the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs talks about clarity . 
would individuals be allowed to self - declare their relationships , or would the government require proof of some kind ? 
if there is such opposition to it , why can government members not exercise a shade of humility and say that perhaps they are not perfect ? 
yes , Mr. Speaker . 
the deputy minister was telling a junior bureaucrat that " we do not design the programs , Parliament designs program , " and " whether a bureaucrat in a given situation thinks the priorities should be this or should be that is not a decision for a bureaucrat . "

Mr. Speaker , I listened carefully and with interest to the remarks of the Reform Party member , which were very justified , given the scandalous situation in which the federal government has placed us .

the department is clearly determined to see that justice is not done in this case . 
it is a balanced approach , exactly what I would have expected of the government .

Mr. Speaker , I also rise on a point of order . 
although by no means making a definitive statement on this issue , I would suggest that with regards to the distribution of the fisheries resources after conservation goals have been met , objectives such as the pursuit of economic and regional fairness , and the recognition of the historical reliance upon , and participation in , the fishery by non - aboriginal groups , are the type of objectives which can ( at least in the right circumstances ) satisfy this standard .

is there some reason for bringing a bill to the Senate on something over which the honourable senator has said we have no authority with which to deal ?

i heard in the House today from the minister of Indian affairs that our member for Skeena had never talked to Nisga ' a . 
how can the Prime Minister continue his intransigent denials over the evidence of three senior RCMP officers who claim the interference came from the PMO ? 
we heard nothing about the important resolution that was passed in 1989 , and only passing remarks about the issue of the fair redistribution of wealth building equity into our society . 
i will offer two figures to illustrate this . 
that took place after extensive consultations with the National Safety Nets Advisory Committee made up of representatives of all major farm commodities .

they all have different privacy codes . 
how are we to include the amendments to the bill required to make it satisfactory to the rest of Canadians ? 
i look forward to the coming years and seeing this happen . 
these two issues correspond to the two conditions laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada as the conditions that would have to be met if the rest of Canada is to be obliged to negotiate secession after any referendum . 
the honourable senator cannot mean legislative supervision because the bill does not impact on that capacity . 
let us see what we can do . 
one thousand Canadians a year are killed on the job and hundreds of thousands of others suffer lost time due to injuries .

Mr. Speaker , I am disappointed because my hon. colleague from Nanaimo - Cowichan had a very important intervention to make on behalf of Mr. Ken Conrad of his riding , which would have been very valuable since he was an RCMP officer who worked closely with aboriginal people in Saskatchewan for a very long time . 
this is a step forward for the advancement of aerospace science .

senator Buchanan : 
madam Speaker , I have discussed with the hon. member for Lac - Saint - Jean , and I find it unfortunate that we are not always talking about this motion as he has moved it . 
the premise of doling out cash and other pre - election goodies is so blatant that everyone is fully able to see exactly what is going on . 
respect of privacy is a fundamental right , which is recognized internationally , as well as in Canada and in Quebec .

Mr. John Maloney 
at three o ' clock in the morning the antics of the Reform Party have cost us $ 924,000 -

it will allow long term planning by the provinces so they can plan five , ten and fifteen years ahead and know they will have funding available .

Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
killing one community in a misguided effort to inject life into another is not good policy .

honourable senators , having followed this issue closely for some years , I am proud to say that Canada has been a leader in working towards this optional protocol and that the government fully supports the outcome . 
what I wish to remind the House , which I thank for the unanimous consent , is that from this moment on , the government must specify with which aboriginal people there are negotiations under way . 
i think there is reason to be worried . 
the current minister ' s predecessor is a sorry figure . 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to respond to my friend in the spirit of non - partisanship and say that I completely support the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development when he says there is no constitutional change brought about by this agreement . 
that is why we must work closely with Canada ' s trucking industry to ensure that we have an environmentally sound and sustainable transportation system into the next millennium . 
not nearly enough resources are put into the health care system to ensure that diabetes no longer becomes the killer of our aboriginal people . 
Mr. Speaker , the auditor general ' s report on the west coast fishery makes it clear that the fishery is headed for disaster unless DFO makes significant changes to improve the management and conservation of Pacific salmon . 
that having been said , we must be allowed the time to go through the decision carefully in order to understand the impact and to conduct the necessary consultations .

it is worth noting that we need that private sector and government partnership .

the next question is on Motion No. 337 . 
not only was our country at the mercy of events , but the government had very limited means to start the process of catching up . 
that was good . 
if we look we will see that the underlying reality of all this is the way in which over the past 10 or 15 years , sometimes for good and well intentioned reasons and other times for less well intentioned reasons , this place , both parliament and government , has abdicated its responsibility in many ways to first the marketplace and in some other ways to the courts . 
introduction and first reading

as the Honourable Senator Forrestall has pointed out in the past , and as he will point out to me again if I am not clear about this , the actual expenditures to bring new aircraft on stream will be a multi - year endeavour .

i will show that CSIS improperly collected information and then subsequently disclosed that information in clear violation of CSIS policy to a third party . 
as a supplementary question , let me give the government leader my thoughts and concerns about this issue .

Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
with some regret I speak on Bill C - 9 , the Nisga ' a final agreement act . 
this bill is , in effect , a not - too - subtle sanctioning of the power of disallowance found in the Constitution , not used since 1943 and rejected by virtually all constitutional scholars and others as being out of date and no longer worthy of being used . 
our government through debates and discussions with all parliamentarians should consider that . 
business investment has much improved with low interest rates . 
this particular one wants to spawn out of the Department of Industry and become a crown corporation .

is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
if Senator Wilson were here , she would be able to answer the question better than I am able to answer it . 
the new president and governing council must be individuals of the highest calibre , capable of commanding the respect of all who are involved with the CIHR .

in fact the member went on to equate legislated segregation with apartheid .

what do we do when we get a bill ? 
the petitioners call on Parliament to move quickly in order to pass legislation making mandatory the labelling of all foods that are wholly or partially genetically modified . 
it is even more so when one has to develop research protocols to ensure that , if humans are asked to take part in research , it will be done with all due respect .

honourable senators , Senator Carstairs has raised an extremely important question . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
hon. St é phane Dion 
there is very little faith not only in the province of Quebec but in every province . 
if that protection was reasonable in the old act , it should continue to be reasonable in whatever replaces that old act until Devco and its assets no longer exist . 
i ask the Minister of Health what he is doing to address the needs of children .

( the House divided on Motion No. 162 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
there is a request for clarification on the orderliness of this motion , in particular the direction that papers and evidence previously received be taken as evidence before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs . 
we would all be better served by that . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , the Labour Congress study confirms what we have known for a long time : woman have been penalized by the employment insurance reform . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i will tell you where they are ahead , Mr. Speaker . 
i was present in the Chamber this morning when the Minister for Agriculture and Agri - Food made his brief presentation and that certainly was not good . 
honourable senators , we are in the same position now as we were in 1984 when it was the wish of the government to create a peace and security institute . 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
this day is extremely significant and I would like to highlight women and human rights . 
they want the serious shortfall in core funding for universities and colleges to be reversed . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 334 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
at this time I can only point out that there is an amendment to the bill which enhanced the access to expenses for candidates who had what we call child care or dependant care expenses . 
let Canadians make no mistake about the net end effect of Bill C - 23 and its implications . 
i want to give the minister credit as well because I did speak to him on this privately outside the Chamber in addition to the question that I asked and he has paid some special attention to it . 
we have moved ahead in the last decade thanks to many champions now in this house on both sides , in particular women such as Senator Sheila Finestone , a former minister responsible for the status of women . 
* * * 
i appreciate it may not be going fast enough , but Nisga ' a is a clear example , whether the member likes the fine print or the details , of a self - government treaty that it is totally beyond my comprehension . 
i know some older people who have lived all their lives in the Portneuf area , who have worked there , have raised their families and are now retired . 
i would like to start my speech today by talking a bit about the philosophical perspective that underpins this piece of legislation and many , if not all , pieces of legislation the Liberal government brings forward in this place . 
every single business , consumer , technology , insurance , bank and even credit - reporting witness who testified before the committee urged the speedy passage of the bill . 
we have of course all become accustomed to any time a Reformer stands up in the House , it is indeed quite good . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member opposite for an excellent speech . 
members 
it concerns the importance of statistics in creating or enhancing economic development in communities . 
motion No. 102 agreed to 
Mr. Speaker , anybody who has watched what this government has said and done over the course of the last five years will understand the very deep feeling of concern that we have for families living in poverty , for farm families in this country , and to improve the lot of the ordinary Canadian . 
the Bloc Quebecois has tried , on two occasions , to change this rule . 
it has made a great deal of fanfare and drawn a great deal of attention to itself as having brought this bold new initiative about , yet it is not prepared to pony up and pay for the programming that is going to be necessary . 
i think it is a marvellous opportunity for our country . 
and what about the provisions dealing with third party interventions , which set a spending limit only for costs related to advertising ? 
madam Speaker , I have here an editorial from the Thursday , January 27 , 2000 issue of Le Devoir . 
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) : 
the Hon. the Speaker pro tempore : 
the committee also recommended " that the federal government , while continuing to respect provincial jurisdiction , renew its strong commitment to post - secondary education . " 
it was clear on reading them that those codes represent a rather higher standard than the consensus - based code of the Canada Standards Association . 
the unsung heroes of the House are the party house leaders . 
honourable senators , I rise today to observe World AIDS Day . 
post - Secondary Education 
honourable senators , the honourable senator is quite right . 
the Late Greg Moore 
Mr. Jay Hill 
we support the bill as regards its purpose and the virtual establishment of such institutes . 
motion agreed to and bill read second time . 
they will come when the government finally figures out that it cannot be the big daddy , the sugar daddy , to everybody and understands that it is the private economy which will create real jobs . 
it was not something they mismanaged . 
despite this new partnership spin , all he really wanted was a yes vote that he could then use to make a unilateral declaration of independence . 
so , can I continue ? 
those hidden killers that maimed or killed over 20,000 women , men and especially children each year are now being destroyed throughout the world . 
it increases the cutoff for the political tax credit to $ 200 from $ 100 for the 75 % rate . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) 
whenever something happens that is a bit of a problem , the government just throws money at it and thinks it will go away . 
it seems that if we starve one child we can be thrown into jail for child abuse , but if we deprive 1.5 million kids of the basic needs to survive , the government calls it balancing the budget and it might even get a person elected as prime minister . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 117 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
GM PLANT IN BOISBRIAND 
i would suggest that a vote be subtracted - 
public accounts show an amount of only $ 47 million . 
procedure and House Affairs 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien : 
how can the minister ignore all this evidence and yet continue to starve out our military ? 
it was a constitutional amendment , not a statute . 
madam Speaker , the member who just spoke talked about opposition from a provincial party to this treaty . 
what is tearing at my heartstrings and what I am pleading with the government to listen to is that I am talking to more and more farmers in that top third who have no land debt and no capital debt who are telling me they may farm one more year and then they will be gone because they now have to borrow on about one - third of their property assets to put in the grain next spring . 
Mr. John Herron 
in August of this year , Canada ' s Minister of Transport wrote to Konrad Von Finckenstein in his capacity as Commissioner of the Competition Bureau . 
and we will seek a commitment from the provinces , who have all asked for this further federal contribution , to build on our investment by increasing their own investments in early childhood development . 
this country needed a few big mouths to stand up to a government that robs Peter to pay Paul , that has no damn plan whatsoever for the people of Sydney , Cape Breton , or anywhere else in Cape Breton . 
( c ) by adding after line 3 on page 11 the following : 
Mr. Greene and his wife were very kind to one of my sisters when we travelled together , and we became friends . 
senator Boudreau : 
this is an interesting treaty because it puts an end to a trusteeship system and paves the way for a model that we , on this side of the House , could be tempted to export . 
thus , the unanimous will of the Senate was completely disregarded . 
honourable senators , Saskatchewan does not have the tax base to meet a 40 - 60 split . 
we think we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg here as has been pointed out over and over again . 
motion No. 315 negatived 
i called for prime ministerial intervention on this issue months ago when it looked like the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International Trade could not get the job done . 
adjournment PROCEEDINGS 
i therefore find myself on the side of those who think that , to make Parliament more relevant in the eyes of Canadians , the ceremony of Royal Assent could even , on occasion , be held in other regions of the country . 
i ask the other members in the House to look beyond their party line and to consider what the people of British Columbia are asking for , which is the chance to place their voice in this discussion . 
Mr. Speaker , earlier this week the Supreme Court of Canada heard an appeal of Alberta ' s firearms reference decision .

Mr. Gerald Keddy 
members 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
is the website information right or is the Minister of Transport right ? 
we have gotten the economy back on track . 
Mr. Speaker , let us hope that the trade minister stiffens his backbone and begins standing up for labour rights and environmental protection . 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
the concern we have is that the government is engaging in almost a corporate re - imaging effort aimed at trying to convince the international community that somehow it is addressing some of the structural deficiencies in the Canadian economy . 
i am proud that members of my caucus have proposed this , as the member for Crowfoot has done . 
Tuesday , December 7 , 1999 
no , it is not . 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Finance has provided the technical response to the finance question , but let me respond to the health question . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
Mr. John Herron 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
these words came from the mouth of the man who went after these same people to get voted into this House and to now be the Prime Minister . 
motion No. 345 negatived 
as the courts have ruled , they should be . 
in other words , a party that would have 12 candidates running in a general election would be entitled to have its party name on the ballot . 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) : 
members 
just exactly where does the government think drugs come into Canada on the west coast ? 
this particular vote has already been deferred . 
he has stated that there was never any meeting between himself and Onex officials . 
there was a real money crunch . 
does the Prime Minister not believe that he must set an example and establish this parliamentary committee as quickly as possible ? 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will withdraw that word if the member gives a - 
does the hon. parliamentary secretary have unanimous consent to move the motion ? 
indeed , if we came to the day when these events all occurred and negotiations were a possibility , someone would have to decide . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
in fact , this bill , along with the 21 st century chairs for research excellence in universities across Canada that were announced in the Speech from the Throne , will give Canada a competitive edge as we move towards the next century . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate my fellow member , the Progressive Conservative Party ' s House leader , for his excellent speech . 
its management is shared by the provincial and federal governments . 
Mr. Myron Thompson 
i declare Motion No. 43 lost . 
that is why I see it as so significant that we have before us legislation that takes the law , one of the best products of the human spirit , one step further , one step forward for mankind , one step into space . 
motion No. 52 negatived 
that Bill C - 9 , in Clause 27 , be amended by replacing line 6 on page 10 with the following : 
the great critic Owen Barfield once wrote : " The most conspicuous point of contact between meaning and poetry is metaphor . " 
honourable senators , I hope that Senator Austin will bear with me while I ask a series of questions on minority rights . 
he is truly a very unusual man . 
aids AWARENESS 
this section protects peace officers across Canada , but there is a question as to whether it will protect the members of the Nisga ' a police service should the Nisga ' a government go that route . 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
when are we going to get some accountability from the minister ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
this may be reviewed by the Speaker . 
it means the waiting period can be far longer for people in the north than for people who are in a community where treatment can be easily accessed . 
in Quebec , we already have homecare and pharmacare programs . 
now we are getting six cents on the dollar for every dollar farmers earn and the Europeans are getting 56 cents , almost 10 times more than Canadians , and the Americans are getting six times more at 38 cents on the dollar . 
senator Rivest : 
sometimes some words are more difficult to translate than others , so we should stay away from it . 
we have the closed - minded , myopic people on the left and then we have the Reform members who would take out some white - out or a big eraser and eliminate the 49 th parallel . 
i welcome him to the House of Commons . 
i will be sharing my time with the member for Chatham - Kent - Essex . 
some hon. members : 
clause 11 of the bill amends section 7 of the Criminal Code by inserting new subsections which have the effect of extending the application of the Criminal Code to the international space station . 
the company has referred the matter to the police and the police are investigating . 
let me be clear , property rights are fundamental to our legal system and society . 
when one goes into a poll , with all the credit card fraud going on , we could at least require all voters to show identification when not on the list . 
to begin with , there is no precedent for this particular case . 
my question to that member and to all other members of the Liberal government involves a couple of things . 
in particular , I thank my secretary , Sallie DeLaplante , who is in the gallery , for her loyalty , assistance and efficiency over such a long period . 
in the case before us , someone is accusing the Minister for International Trade of having received services that were not recorded . 
Mr. Speaker , I thought I would not have a chance to talk about this motion today , but I am a very fortunate man . 
i should point out that there are codes of conduct in various forms in other jurisdictions , such as the United Kingdom and Australia as well as in some provinces in Canada . 
as the committee ' s majority suggested , we can give Canadians from across the country the opportunity to express their views first and monitor the progress later . 
supply 
any weak link should be addressed through appropriate training of returning officers when they are hired . 
that has now been removed . 
i would hope that we would not use terms which would cause disorder because that is what I am referring to . 
not only are municipalities recognized in the constitution , unlike Canada , but there is a ministry of urban affairs .

seventh , we would eliminate other forms of discrimination between conjugal and non - conjugal couples . 
senator Fraser went on to say that it could also be done by way of resolution . 
it is historic and one that all Canadians will benefit from as a result of the movement of this government and I believe rightfully so . 
is this creative accounting on the part of the Minister of Finance and the government ? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney : 
agricultural Income Disaster Assistance Program - Allocation of More Funds - Request for Clarification on Minister ' s Statement 
frankly , I am not aware of either Canada ' s or the minister ' s position , if he has expressed one to date . 
that , in the opinion of this House , the government should recognize the 55 th parallel as the identified Canadian boundary for participation in the international circumpolar community . 
if people in Quebec believe it will still be possible to elect members of parliament here after sovereignty , obviously , the question is not clear . 
i would point members to a very useful presentation we received at committee from a well - known health researcher and policy analyst in the country today , Bob Evans . 
i stated earlier that the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada does not in any way , shape or form support closure on this matter . 
if it gets the right spin , if it gets the right story out to enough people , it can garner support by saying it has addressed the youth justice issue , for example . 
that Bill C - 6 be amended by deleting Clause 4.3.4 of Schedule 1 . 
hon. Wilbert J . Keon : 
as late as last week we met with several farm groups and representatives from out west . 
Mr. Speaker , the regional diversity of Canada is witnessed by everyone who travels the country , but the agricultural industry and the family farm are in crisis . 
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur 
members 
now the government is saying that it is doing so wonderfully it will be returning $ 11.5 billion in the next five years . 
it must not be forgotten that the MAI , much criticized for having been negotiated among the rich countries only , was finally abandoned as an object of negotiation by the OECD , in response to lobbying . 
hear , hear ! 
i was blocked from the ability to do that . 
tabled 
i am sure that the hon. member is just about to come back to the subject being discussed today . 
we announced earlier today that the additional $ 170 million that the federal government is putting forward for this program will enable us to cover a percentage of negative margins . 
it is an area where we have important interests at stake and where we can exercise meaningful influence and leadership . 
the next question is on Motion No. 290 . 
this prime ministerial vision of the future is one of a Canada that excludes Quebec , that thumbs its nose at Quebec ' s concerns and traditional demands . 
it seems that the federal government has not taken the lead as they said they would .

the country will pay dearly for this slavish devotion to special interests . 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
honourable senators , I will begin my remarks on Bill C - 9 by showing you my file on the Nisga ' a Final Agreement .

hon. Douglas Roche : 
at the very end of my remarks , I wish to indicate my support for the principles of this bill . 
there were comparisons made between 1974 and 1998 which relate everything back to bushels of grain .

honourable Senator Hays ) . 
we have been able , through the foundation , to write agreements with all provinces and territories except for Quebec , but I am optimistic that we can do it there for the betterment and the support of students in Quebec . 
we should be trying to strip down some of the existing legislation , or at least have something in place that says if we put a new bill in , we take another bill out . 
it relates to the consensual entry in the data bank of the results from a forensic DNA analysis of bodily substances that have been either voluntarily provided during a criminal investigation or taken under a DNA warrant during the investigation .

hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :

when people talk to us they ask us to legislate . 
that is why our own army and our armed forces have taken such an active role in places like Cambodia and Bosnia to try to eliminate the land mines . 
they can actually have it registered in their name , that it belongs to their families , that they can give it to their children .

i personally am always in favour of allegiance to the Pope .

i have three examples . 
the establishment of an Office of Children ' s Environmental Health will be considered as part of this action plan , but no decision has yet been taken on whether to create such an office . 
instead of focusing on constructive comments of what we can do about the shipbuilding industry , I heard about the farmers and I heard about HRDC . 
why do they not refute the claims that I have made in terms of their position ? 
i cannot get over such a diagnostic ! 
there was discussion of coming to a consensus and agreeing on a more practical limit of 12 candidates to be recognized as a registered political party . 
this act fails on all those counts . 
now I ask , how does a bocce court give a foundation to the economic well - being of our country ? 
the properties on reserve lands under claim by inheritance belonged to my grandfather , the legendary lacrosse goalie , Henry Hawkeye Baker , who was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1966 , and the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame in 1999 . Hawkeye , a Squamish born native man , also played for Canada with honour , pride and dignity in the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles , where the team won a bronze medal . 
the first is that one may not ask a question of a previous minister or a minister who is no longer responsible . 
however , I do not know if that was their reasoning . 
Cape Bretoners faced long term decisions on the government ' s initiatives .

i do not think there is anybody in the country who does not agree that the rules of the game have to be laid out in the beginning . 
that is why having a united front , having all the agriculture groups in Canada and the provinces all onside with a united position is the best way to make a difference internationally . 
when my caucus visited Shawinigan a year ago with a lot of our friends from the press they found that Shawinigan is much more attractive than it was before .

peace starts at home . 
we want to ensure that the lives of Canadians are improved through better access to global markets and through predictable and enforceable rules governing trade . 
i ask again , why is the Prime Minister failing to lead a delegation against European and U.S. subsidies ? 
parliament passed legislation , Bill C - 78 , that extended survivor pension benefits to same sex partners of federal public service employees , as have Manitoba , Quebec , Saskatchewan , British Columbia , Ontario , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Yukon , Nunavut and the Northwest Territories .

Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
increasing numbers of protests forced Mr. Sciortino and Mr. Riggi to defend the commission ' s decision . 
members 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
again far too often the government comes back with legislation that is more cumbersome , more lengthy , full of loopholes and more bureaucratic red tape than the legislation it was seeking to replace . 
i want to talk briefly about some of the issues in my area in British Columbia that are not being addressed by the bill . 
i thought this was an invention of the native people of the Yukon , but the Nisga ' a have assured me that they are the ones who invented it .

in the spirit of that co - operation , I would like to propose the following to the House . 
remembrance DAY 
Mr. Andr é Harvey 
No. 
what has happened in Alberta and Ontario since those governments have taken charge is that we have seen a reduction in taxes , a reduction in debt and ultimately a huge increase in the number of people working in those provinces . 
i believe it is purported by the government that the boundaries of Canada are still from the Queen Charlotte Islands , past Victoria , right through to Newfoundland and past Prince Edward Island . 
motion No. 51 
i will , however , never give up my right to speak . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie 
the committee , as honourable senators are aware , decided to append an observation to the fourth report . 
Normand and Martine Rousseau , of Notre - Dame - du - Bon - Conseil , and Camilien Belhumeur , the mayor of St - Guillaume , took first place with a magnificent sculpture of the " Rocket '' , Maurice Richard , a hero to Quebecers and the ideal person to illustrate the passion of our people . 
Mr. Richard Marceau 
let me finish . 
motion No. 141 negatived 
Mr. Speaker , at last I get to speak on the Nisga ' a treaty . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 279 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
Mr. Greg Thompson 
resumption of debate on Address in Reply 
i thank the honourable senator for his comments . 
there are those in the opposition who want the government to throw out this successful program and replace it with an acreage payment . 
child POVERTY 
the Speaker : 
i did not have the heart to tell them that the Prime Minister was having a fundraiser at the Congress Centre , because it cost $ 350 each to get in . 
- examine the possibility of the government using its regulatory power under the Contraventions Act as an additional means of implementing a harm reduction policy , as is done in other jurisdictions ; 
in order to avoid abuses , the bill stipulates that the verification may not be used for any other purpose except assessment of an application . 
those who take an interest in this issue know full well that the House expressed its opinion very clearly last week , at second reading . 
given the failure in Seattle , Canada must pursue bilateral agreements on agriculture and provide urgently needed short term assistance . 
yesterday I was also informed by a search and rescue employee in St. John ' s that the budget is so tight , search and rescue vessels are forced to stay in port and are not allowed to go out unless an absolute emergency occurs . 
i listened to the Prime Minister promise that . 
we are moving into the 21 st century and we are still using the outdated institutions of the past to proceed into a new century . 
hon. Maria Minna ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
however , often the challenges farmers face throughout the country are as diverse as the commodities they produce . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , debate adjourned . 
the next question is on Motion No. 440 . 
the Bloc Quebecois members have long been calling for a reform of the federal elections act . 
Mr. Speaker , at first blush , the Minister of Finance seems to be sitting very pretty . 
they are going backwards . 
we would therefore have to take that particular factor into very serious account . 
it was provided for in the other act . 
the next question is on Motion No. 118 . 
millennium SCHOLARSHIPS 
i submit to the member that if he reads the act very carefully he will see that the act exactly does not do that . 
if there are differences they cannot surmount then the effect of the application of the constitution and the charter is that the constitutional principles and due process of law including judicial review are there . 
the Defence Department has said that these types of claymore mines , the positive - control antipersonnel fragmentation devices , are exempt from the treaty that Canada signed with the rest of the world because these mines must be detonated deliberately by Canadian force personnel only upon identifying the target . 
that was the whole issue . 
but , if we do not resolve firmly to label genetically engineered products , we will not get very far selling to the Pacific . 
in the riding of Beauce - Nord , Normand Poulin was elected with a majority of about 100 votes .

Mr. Speaker , western farm families are being driven off their land by the deep pockets of European and American treasuries . 
what can we do to make the people who live in cities understand what is happening on the family farm ? 
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Lethbridge , Trade ; the hon. member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , CSIS ; the hon. member for Okanagan - Coquihalla , National Defence . 
governments must have resources to function . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) moved : 
Mr. Speaker , if the finance minister would take off his blinders when he reads Reform material he would get it right . 
even had the government not introduced this measure , which I would have preferred it did not , it would not mean that the executive power would have been free of supervision by Parliament . 
that is a travesty of democracy . 
that having been said , I again urge the member to contact the authorities directly , because he is well aware that an RCMP investigation is already under way . 
but Mr. Justice Barry Davis has granted Walcot a constitutional exemption , which means he will not serve the mandatory four year minimum sentence for a crime involving a firearm . 
i have no factual evidence to back this up and no scientific proof that substances such as EDTA work . 
there is no way to get here from there . 
some hon. members : 
Mr. Speaker , Sunday is Halloween and again this year UNICEF will have over two million tiny volunteers collecting coins in support of less fortunate children around the world . 
the exclusion of visible minorities from their just portion of the employment pie is a phenomenon that affects every sector of our society . 
these are not idle remarks . 
it would raise the maximum penalty for impaired driving causing death from 14 years to life imprisonment , as recommended by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights in its report . 
the government denies it . 
railways Bill 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Mr. Denis Paradis 
he was prepared to suspend the democratic rights of those students rather than embarrass a foreign despot . 
if there is one thing the government can do effectively , it can co - ordinate tourist areas to find destinations to which people want to travel and designate marketing areas , for instance the European Union , southeast Asia and so forth , in which to tell our story . 
we believe in a vision for 21 st century Canada which includes the notion of political leadership not just by the federal government but by all levels of government working in effective partnerships with the private sector , the non - profit and co - operative sector , labour representatives , and primary producers for something that is bigger than ourselves . 
our cultural and linguistic ties with Quebec are solidly rooted in the Franco - Manitoban community centred in St. Boniface . 
what was really important when I met with the chiefs in Atlantic Canada was the long term issue . 
is there unanimous consent of the House ? 
members 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
access documents revealed that the human resources department asks " Where can HRDC get the most mileage ? " 
hon. David M. Collenette 
i apologize to anyone now in the Senate whom I have not mentioned who also sat on the joint committee as a permanent member . 
we could have a strong dollar and a sustained economic growth if we allowed Canadians to actually enjoy some of the prosperity that other countries are enjoying and actually took the initiative to provide significant tax reform and tax reduction and also address some of these other structural issues , the types of issues which were addressed under the previous government . 
members 
we knew what was at stake . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a question of privilege . 
Yes. 
we will be discussing with the provinces an accord which essentially lives up to the International Joint Commission report of the Great Lakes area but in addition deals with the issue of interbasin transfers for water beyond just exports . 
honourable senators , I have the honour to rise in support of Bill C - 13 , to establish the Canadian Institutes of Health Research . 
a study conducted by the Quebec Order of Nurses indicates that the situation will get worse as baby - boomer nurses retire over the next 15 years , while the numbers of nursing grads dwindle . 
hon. Senators : 
they come from a part of this country where they know that the Lord says in the Bible - 
the committee clearly recognized that Canada ' s foreign policy on cultural , scientific and educational matters was an integral part , with the provinces ' involvement , of the implementation of national policy . 
they did not deal with section 47 , though . 
according to their decision , the Government of Ontario ' s Health Services Restructuring Commission acted illegally in ordering the closure of this hospital , the only French - language teaching hospital in Ontario . 
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) : 
with the bill , the government wants to establish marine conservation areas under the responsibility of Heritage Canada , marine protection areas under the responsibility of Fisheries and Oceans and marine wildlife areas under the responsibility of Environment Canada . 
Mr. Speaker , I move that the first report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri - Food , presented on Tuesday , February 22 , be concurred in .

in my opinion the nays have it . 
how about Reform - R - Us - Eh ? 
as part of this program they randomly target applicants to verify the information they provided and to explore in detail whether or not the information is accurate . 
that narrow - minded vision creates the situations we face day in and day out in the international community . 
hon. Jane Stewart 
Newfoundlanders had the highest rate of making financial contributions to charities in Canada , with 84 per cent of the population over 15 years of age giving to help others . 
there have been 89 attempted murders , 129 cases of arson and 82 bombings . 
then the other Reform member was talking about increased expenditure on defence . 
Beacause the Minister of Industry , through the minister responsible for economic development for the Quebec regions , told the House that the federal government had its own strategy . 
first of all , it is quite a challenge to find a job . 
we must rely on television , radio and the newspapers . 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Justice Richard was very clear in his intent when he wrote : 
i want to add my voice to the record in giving thanks to Dr. Henry Friesen and many others who contributed to bringing the bill forward . 
what is wrong with that ? 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold : 
government Commitments to Alleviate Poverty to Human Rights Committee 
i know there is another means for obtaining justice . 
( motion No. 32 negatived ) 
the problem with that party is that it wants to play politics . 
Mr. Speaker , this is truly amazing . 
liaison Officers in Foreign Countries : 
on October 1 he announced that he would seek a short term deal with the native community for a moratorium that would not rule out acting unilaterally if a decision was not reached . 
if the House gives its consent , I intend to move concurrence in the 11 th report later this day .

( 2 ) The committee designated or established for the purpose of subsection ( 1 ) shall , as soon as practicable , undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions and operation of this Act and shall , within five years after the review is undertaken , submit a report to the House of Commons . " 
that is why we may have to try to go as far as we can in seeking a consensus , so as to achieve near - unanimity in the House of Commons regarding this legislation . 
introduction and first reading 
fifth Report of Committee Adopted 
the pace of change , not just the nature of change , is very different . 
senator Fraser : 
although the main thrust of the motions that we are discussing right now deal with patronage appointments to Elections Canada , I know that the minister is completely unresponsive to any of the amendments that were proposed to fix the problem , just as he is completely unresponsive to any of the court rulings which have shown him he is misguided in other areas of the bill . 
why would the government not agree to some basic changes to the bill to ensure transparency and accountability ? 
honourable senators , the Nisga ' a should not have to give up their culture and language to live in this great country . 
that will be dealt with in co - operation with the RCMP , treasury board and my department . 
let us get back to the throne speech and the title , " A Better Quality of Life '' . 
it also notes the concerns of the Secretary - General of the United Nations on this subject . 
payments will be advanced only when the documentation is there , and I am speaking of documentation in terms of claims , expenses and so on . 
in conclusion , I would like to say that millions of Canadians from outside Quebec also believe that we cannot accept the status quo . 
why force them to go to court when the remedy is so simple ? 
however , a scant five years before signing this document that has now been immortalized , then lieutenant - governor Lawrence signed another , on August 11 , 1755 , in which he gave instructions to Colonel John Winslow . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) moved : 
this is a pretty strange way to finish up this millennium . 
the party opposite neglects ordinary people . 
in our society today , we have a right not only to know the results but to know how the results are arrived at . 
according to simple grade 3 mathematics it is obvious we are still deeply in the hole . 
authoritarian governments , however , simply have not realistically demonstrated that free thought , speech , the establishment of mass organizations and the criticism of leaders is incompatible with the rights of subsistence and development .

all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
Mr. Gary Lunn 
it is a question of respect in the most primitive sense . 
is that the agenda ? 
it is succeeding . 
it cannot be , because Canada does not have the means to stop Quebec from selling its own tourist attractions . 
honourable senators , I have a response to a question raised in the Senate on February 23 , 2000 by Senator Spivak regarding a motion to establish an Office of Children ' s Environmental Health . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
whereas these objectives can best be achieved by replacement of the Young Offenders Act with a new legal framework for the youth criminal justice system ; 
the treaty is recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Canadian constitution , but it does not become part of the constitution . 
whether it is Bill C - 10 , the Municipal Grants Act , or any other piece of legislation in this place , the government seems to simply be on autopilot . 
neither the supreme court ' s opinion nor the draft bill introduced on December 10 , 1999 , if passed , would preclude asking such a question . 
since the 15 minutes was not used for bells , the suggestion by the member for Joliette just plain makes sense . 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
yea . 
Canadians have heard these words from the government . 
they are leaving Canada , and so go the jobs .

YUGOSLAVIA 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with great interest to the comments by our colleague from Elk Island . 
the Speaker : 
would he not agree that with the recent decision by the aboriginal chiefs in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to lift the moratorium it would be a very wise idea for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to get on an airplane and head down to that area to deal with the issue immediately ? 
it is an indefensible bill . 
again , this is an opportunity for Canadian companies to have a vehicle for research and development , perhaps with some co - operation through the labs that are on board with the United States and Russia . 
we will continue to give the government some suggestions and solutions . 
of course , I cannot congratulate her on her preliminary remarks on the clarity bill .

the treaty represents a delicate balance of interests and reflects the compromises and trade offs made by all parties through years of these difficult negotiations .

honourable senators , I have not examined in detail the numbers for the other provinces , but I very much expect that they will be similar , particularly in regard to benefits that come under the equalization agreements . 
my colleague from Skeena and I had to fight just to get people who were opposed to be heard .

in B.C. the government tried to do this recently . 
more than 10 years later , even though the solicitor general ' s department has now confirmed that Canada ' s sloppy immigration system has turned us into a haven for organized crime , absolutely nothing has been done to address these problems .

hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
they have been ravished by government cutbacks and like a tired animal they are asking for assistance instead of having more heaped on to their backs . 
once again I have heard no response . 
we want nothing to do with the department of Indian affairs except to dismantle it over time and transfer its functions and funding responsibility to accountable aboriginal governments . 
the social union , originally developed by the premiers , developed some controls or guidelines with which they could all agree , a dispute mechanism and an understanding that if a province wanted to withdraw or not take part in an agreed program , it would have the right to do so and still get the dollars that should go to the people of that province . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 415 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
we have heard the same thing from the business community , as well as the aboriginal community . 
will the government do the right thing and arrange for the release of the taped telephone conversations between the minister and his Parole Board appointee so that the air can be cleared and we can find out the minister ' s involvement in this case ? 
i think that these round tables are more useful than an ombudsman would be , because the constructive solutions put forward are in sync with the values of the first nations , as well as with the legislation and guidelines of the various provinces . 
if this is about giving individuals the ability to have financial freedom and financial entitlement in a broader , more open way , perhaps that is where we should be going . 
members 
why do we not have broader consultation with the scientists and the researchers to see where this critical mass might be gathered and made best use of ?

hon. Lorne Nystrom : 
suffice it to acknowledge that although we do not yet have a body of scientific knowledge about human evil worthy of being dignified by the term ` psychology ' , behavioral scientists have laid a foundation that makes the development of such a psychology possible . 
however , there are problems , which some of us have alluded to in our speeches at second reading . 
this week , a most interesting letter by former minister Marc Lalonde was printed in Le Devoir . 
the Speaker : 
what is the problem with the government ? 
however , what this bill does is discharge the government from its obligation to negotiate because the government will decide what is a clear question and what is a clear majority . 
in short , Alberta is urging that this bill be reconsidered and that there be stricken from the bill those sections that intrude upon the jurisdiction of provinces to enable small - and medium - sized businesses to adequately prepare for the legislation and to enable a consultative process to be renewed to achieve the goal of privacy protection .

Quebec has jurisdiction over personal information , and it has exercised that jurisdiction quite well for 15 or 20 years , because it has legislation in place and has enforced it . 
nevertheless that does not preclude them from getting the same genuine support from a government that has the money .

in many cases the government gets lucky and these people end up doing a very good job , but that is not always the case . 
in other words , this allows them to target people they want to target , but it will not ensure that people really have had physical presence in the country three years out of six . 
those who cannot remember history are doomed to repeat it . 
once again , it can be seen that the two governments are guided by two very different mindsets .

honourable Senator Fraser ) . 
members 
i am doing the math and it does not look good for the provinces . 
with the year 2000 mere weeks away , we are forced to admit that we are still very far from giving anything more than lip service to their right to a full - fledged role as citizens . 
many people have called in simply to express relief that housing is finally on the agenda .

Mr. Speaker , if the simple amalgamation of municipalities requires more than 50 % plus one , would such a majority be enough to break up a country ? 
notice of Inquiry 
honourable senators will find that this report is thorough and contains significant detail on our committee ' s deliberations . 
people believed them and elected them , but they never kept their promises . 
Mr. Speaker , I listened carefully to the answer by the hon. member . 
i too have a story for the Leader of the Opposition . 
section 61 of the decision places the limitations of the Marshall decision within context . 
she wrote a letter in 1996 to the Prime Minister saying this : 
however , here they are ready to rubber - stamp this without giving that right to the natives themselves . 
i am sure all hon. members know that immunity accorded to members in the House does not exist when statements are made outside the House . 
Mr. Tom Wappel ( Scarborough Southwest , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 320 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( offence committed outside Canada ) . 
that is what we expect in the House and we appreciate that . 
there seems to be a perception that continues to permeate from the Liberal government to central Canadians and some western Canadians that what is happening in Cape Breton is really Cape Bretoners ' own fault . 
i can certainly inquire and if there is a specific reason that would not breach national security if we shared it , then I would certainly be prepared to bring that information to the Senate . 
the enhancement of the Nisga ' a identity , which is ensured by the establishment of new self - governing powers , the transfer of lands and resources , and the removal from the authoritarian provisions of the Indian Act , promises in future times a larger and more influential role in the public , social and economic affairs of the province for the aboriginal community as a whole . 
Ms Mary Robinson , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , has spoken out to governments in favour of protecting potential victims . 
that is not why this mine cannot make money . 
one cannot run a business without knowing what to expect tomorrow . 
this government has recognized that all Canadians must have access to life - long learning and the promise that the digital revolution represents . 
a fine officer , a man who is dedicated to this country has paid a fair price in terms of his health as a result of this . 
there is clarification of the purpose of the act ; strengthening parental responsibility ; recognition of victims rights ; the provision of support services for victims ; stronger differentiation between violent repeat offenders and non - violent first time offenders ; strengthening sentencing provisions ; publication of the names of young offenders ; changes to the age of application in the Young Offenders Act ; and provisions for rehabilitation and prevention . 
i had the honour of serving in the House with him .

hon. Jane Stewart 
i heard some noise from my Conservative colleagues . 
in its principle and purposes , Bill C - 8 meets laudable objectives , that is the conservation of animal and plant life in marine areas . 
it is obvious that the ethics commissioner of Ontario and the attorney general are investigating Mr. Mulder . 
i do not understand how the minister could make a statement like that without thinking about how it would impact and how it would get people like Mazie Baker thinking . 
the space agency , which is located in Saint - Hubert , is a very good thing for the aerospace industry . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy 
one hon. member insisted that although this bill is sound , that it would be inappropriate for the Reform Party to introduce it at this time given the events of the last few weeks which involved a former justice critic of the official opposition . 
the system already exists . 
thank you , honourable senators . 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak to Bill C - 2 even though I have a lot of problems with this bill . 
while this may also be true of other provinces , we all know that , in Quebec , research , and health research in particular , has been extremely hard hit by the cuts made by the central government . 
but the minister still wants to review the rules concerning the majority needed in a referendum . 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
they would not have been there without government intervention . 
Mr. Speaker , again , we support the principle of pay equity , of equal pay for equal work .

the more consumption is taxed , the less consumption we have . 
i thank Senator Corbin for his question . 
we will now revert to the introduction of private members ' bills . 
we talk about grants , but my colleague from Saint - Jean asked last week why we called it grants since they are basically payments of property taxes . 
in particular we will propose to reduce the current residency requirement for the board of directors of companies incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act from a majority to 25 % .

even the Canadian Medical Association is saying that we need an extra $ 1.5 billion per year in health care . 
she is the one responsible . 
lastly , I would like to address concerns regarding employment . 
these two sections of the opinion are highly significant and are more than sufficient to justify the role the federal government intends to play in clarifying the referendum issue . 
all this information is presented to the public for comment in the regulatory impact analysis statement .

Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
if they do not have it , they will not be putting seed in the ground this spring . 
this is a bill that will amend the Municipal Grants Act . 
this is a democracy of disallowance , a sick democracy because it wants to disallow the national assembly , to disallow a national assembly that always had the privilege and the authority to adopt a question , to decide what Quebecers would be consulted on , to frame a question which was debated by the national assembly for 35 hours , which was debated by majority and opposition parties , sovereignist and federalist parties , and which was finally adopted by the assembly , the seat of the sovereignty of the Quebec people , who must continue to freely decide its own future . 
i am sure that all hon. members will want to comply with the rules of the House of Commons . 
we still hearken back to our debt to the ancient Greeks for introducing mankind to the concepts of law for all people which has to go before democracy .

they see the very real damage that this agreement will cause in British Columbia and , by extension , all across Canada . 
we will reserve our position until we have an opportunity to look at this bill in greater detail at committee . 
it should be clear to all those carefully examining the Nisga ' a treaty that it falls perfectly within the scope of the Canadian Constitution . 
i encourage the government to look at that in all ministries and departments .

of course these initiatives are worth the time and worthy of praise .

we , too , want out of this cage . 
we cannot oppose the principle of creating health research institutes in various target areas of public health .

No. 
we are at second reading stage of this bill and the fact that municipalities throughout Canada and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities have not even had an opportunity for input is a real shame . 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to come back to your ruling . 
when will he start protecting consumers instead of big business ? 
it think it is doing that because the Minister of Transport is favouring the proposition put forward by Mr. Gerald Schwartz who is the president of Onex .

on the contrary , trade is the answer . 
i saw with my own eyes the hard work done by my opposition colleagues .

i have confidence in these people . 
in the last two weeks alone there have been three decisions that have forced Canada to expand and open its markets . 
therefore , to suggest that the statistics are truly indicative of the numbers of impaired drivers on the highway is quite wrong . 
the committee was interested in this question because , for a number of years , especially since the government started its fight against the deficit , the army has been in large measure hit with budget restrictions .

the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
in fact , some companies had indicated that they would be interested in the Halifax area , but feared that the employment availability would not be such as to support the type of operation they had in mind . 
Mr. Speaker , I am certainly pleased today to join the debate on Bill C - 13 , the Canadian institutes of health research bill . 
we also found that there was not enough support for conflict of interest provisions , which the NDP health critic talked about very eloquently . 
consequently , I wish to declare for the record that I intend to abstain from voting when the question is put for the third reading of Bill C - 4 . 
thus , they are not in the police records system .

we want to talk about all those in the farm communities who rely on farmers , the fuel suppliers , the pesticide and fertilizer outlets , the equipment dealers , the grain companies and railroads and all their employees . 
this democracy is also characterized by closure . 
how would the government explain to the people of the world that kind of embarrassment ? 
motion agreed to . 
from personal experience I can say that there is an arrogance at the bureaucracy level of the federal government . 
the CIHR would make researchers accountable for all budgetary expenditures and report on a yearly basis to an overseeing committee of their peers to assess their progress . 
honourable senators , yesterday , you probably received , like me , a release from the National Press Club , announcing that the person to whom I just referred , John Roth , Nortel Networks President , will deliver a speech on Wednesday , December 1 , 1999 , in Ottawa . 
it is equally a major loss for Canada because , having granted preapproval , the rest of Canada will not be able to challenge the question . 
if something is broken and there is an opportunity to fix it , why not fix it ? 
that in no way diminishes my concern for the second part of the bill dealing with electronic documents . 
i hope the member remembers my comments about the public - private partnerships which I think will be inevitable in areas like Atlantic Canada that have an infrastructure deficit . 
in 1995 , the current Minister of Finance cut more than $ 6 billion from Canada ' s national health program .

they are therefore calling upon the Government of Canada and the Parliament of Canada to support Taiwan ' s membership in the World Health Organization . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik 
when we break away from the equality of all Canadians , when we start assigning special status or special rights or special access to resources , when we start assigning different rights to people on any basis , we have a recipe for disaster . 
we need only look to the east coast to see what happens when that leadership is lacking , when we fail to negotiate in good faith with those affected , with respect and with forethought . 
honourable senators , we have always said that our standards on human rights will be applied as consistently as possible around the world . 
it is about some of the words that were fired over to us during the last voting procedure particularly angry that the NDP only got 2.5 % in the byelection - 
thanks to public opinion and because ordinary citizens sent faxes , phoned the riding offices and condemned this idea I would describe as stupid , that of giving tax deductions to hockey millionaires , the government thought about it for three days , then changed its mind . 
we see that Canada has already had some notable people in the health care field . 
the minister has said repeatedly that the health and safety of our members is paramount and that no Sea King will be permitted to fly if it puts our soldiers ' lives at risk . 
when a bureaucrat believes it is in the public interest that a certain end be achieved , there needs to be transparency and accountability in parliament prior to that change being effected . 
at this time , I am not able to indicate to the honourable senator what the result of that investigation was or , in fact , whether it is still ongoing . 
i welcome and wholeheartedly support Bill S - 2 precisely because it aims to address many of the complex reasons health providers cling to saving lives at all costs . 
it simply is not the case . 
and the interpretation of treaties in particular must be generous and liberal . 
the Speaker : 
philosophically there are a number of issues we are compatible on , but he was not putting out factually correct information on four specific issues related to my community in downtown Toronto . 
honourable senators , it should be remembered also that there are life - threatening situations that are not associated with imminent and unavoidable death . 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
it might be something different than courage but I will not go there . 
considering the importance of the trucking industry both in Quebec and in Canada , it is totally justifiable for governments to want to assume their responsibilities . 
i do not have the time to go into them .

one of the fundamental principles of the existing act , and one which the amendments to the act we are bringing forward propose to continue and enhance is the right of Canadians to have a broad selection of candidates from which to choose ; candidates that do not present themselves only on the basis of having adequate financial resources , but candidates who can present themselves on the basis of a broad range of experiences comparable to those of their fellow Canadians . 
i offer the government this opportunity to take corrective action by voting to strengthen property rights in the Canadian bill of rights .

but while the minister was making those statements , we know that she had an audit on her desk that showed that eight out of ten files reviewed showed no evidence of financial monitoring , 87 % of the files showed no evidence of supervision and 15 % did not even have the name of the person they were giving the money to . 
at page 97 of our Asia - Pacific report , we indicated that foreign policy takes into account factors supporting adherence to human rights issues , such as good governance , democratization and civil society , the rule of law and the need for an independent judiciary . 
is this not obvious ? 
is it possible for such a man , under our current political system , to have exceptional power and a veto on the future of Quebecers , on the future of a whole nation ? 
Mr. Speaker , the member for Beauharnois - Salaberry is criticizing the Canadian government for constantly saying that Canada is the best country in the world . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) : 
it is clearly in the wrong order . 
all those opposed will please say nay .

even the Government of British Columbia said the Salmon Arm turnout was the biggest it had in regard to the Nisga ' a agreement . 
honourable senators , I wish to make a comment on the creation of terms of reference on a broad issue such as fisheries , which is essential and which I support completely . 
instead of having to outline their complaint to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , they would have an independent ombudsman office that would address their concerns . 
in the spirit of the season I would ask you to seek unanimous consent to record the hon. member for Surrey Central as having voted on the motion he was inadvertently missed on . 
canada , quite wisely , opted for the idea of income insurance . 
introduction and first reading 
report of Committee Adopted 
will the minister finally admit that his pseudo decentralization , he who likes substantive debates , debates on semantics , is merely devolution , in which those who have money - 
we are talking about exceptions whereby the government could , without the knowledge of the individual - what is meant by that is explained further on - collect information without the consent of this individual . 
standing Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations 
i respect the hon. member ' s views very much . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 111 , which was agreed to on the following division : ) 
fifty years ago , less than 200,000 aboriginal people were counted . 
Mr. Speaker , I think that is exactly what the government is doing . 
as borders are tightened around the world , organized criminal networks provide the only chance for many people in their search for security and a better life . 
i declare the motion carried . 
the following points were raised in committee and through New Democratic Party meetings and correspondence with stakeholders . 
householders were sent to 534,000 homes in B.C. , most of them in ridings held by Liberal MPs . In one riding 81.5 % said not to vote for the bill . 
when the bill was before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , the Bloc Quebecois asked for a voters identification process to be included in the legislation . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the only difference is in the order in which the words are presented . 
in addition , I wanted - and would like to convince my colleagues in the House of this - the government to do a better job than it is currently doing of making the content of treaties known , not only by tabling them in the House , but by publishing them in various forms , electronically for example , on an electronic site such as that of the Department of Foreign Affairs .

Mr. Jason Kenney 
honourable senators , the arbitration act of the Province of British Columbia would provide all the guidance .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
there are certain conditions that foster organized crime . 
naturally , I will be given no answer , because no statistic or study has shown that imprisonment has a real impact on crime rates . 
right now , the government is pocketing between $ 6 and $ 7 billion , having reduced eligibility for these programs and worked it so that now people pay premiums from the first hour of work . 
the emphasis of the phrase " with all deliberate speed " was that it would not be a solution achieved in one day , or in a single ruling , but might require a number of years of supervision , monitoring , consulting with and directing the parties . 
8 . The then Deputy Judge Advocate General ( litigation ) in relation to the Somalia occurrence ; and

i declare Motion No. 413 lost . 
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Burnaby - Douglas , Natural Disasters ; the hon. member for Palliser , Agriculture . 
plight of Western Grain Farmers - Response by Government 
i am absolutely delighted to speak on this the last throne speech for the 20 th century and hopefully , if the voters from the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke see fit , I will be here for the first of many throne speeches delivered from this side of the House I might add , so that we will continue to charge on to greatness for this wonderful country called Canada . 
if no other honourable senators wish to speak , I will proceed with the motion . 
asking for a clear question and a clear majority does not violate the prerogatives of the national assembly . 
they are just as often victims of crime by youth and by adults . 
bills S - 15 and C - 108 , whose aim was to add sexual orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act , were introduced in the Senate and the House of Commons respectively .

i wonder if you would take them into consideration please . 
there will be a lot of practical issues and we will be here day after day to remind the Minister of Industry of the negative impact that his bill will have in Quebec . 
we are a part of NATO and thus we are responsible for NATO ' s actions . 
this is an unbelievable boondoggle . 
i would say to Her Honour that there is wide support in the chamber for such a finding . 
Mr. Speaker , I rose on a point of order a few minutes ago with respect to the comments of the member for Skeena who , in reference to the minister and the government , used the words " deliberately " and " misrepresent '' . 
i find it hard to believe that the minister was not informed of the plan when she was at committee .

aboriginal AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
members 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
but I remind all those who are listening to us that other agreements have also gone quite far . 
the hon. member says that it is non - constitutional . 
we need positive action and we need it now . 
another point that has been raised by my colleagues through numerous amendments is the idea of giving more money to parties to encourage more female candidates . 
if this bill will only affect , as the minister argued , a very small portion of the health care sector in the first three years after it is proclaimed , then clearly there is a window of opportunity to clarify the effects of this bill on the particularly sensitive and intimate personal health information without jeopardizing the impact of the bill on the remaining and vast commercial sector . 
that is why I am permitting the hon. member to intervene now , but I would ask her to be very precise in what she has to say . 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
their testimony reflected the tremendous costs of poverty to both the individuals and to society . 
the pension bill was delayed from June until September in order to allow Treasury Board and the Public Service Alliance an opportunity to meet over the summer months to try to iron out certain misunderstandings , especially with regard to the surplus . 
why is it that the government does not take the same accountable approach in terms of spending as do municipal governments ? 
i would say that is a pretty solid business . 
what is it they object to ? 
our annual export and import growth of 8.1 % and 6.4 % , respectively , far outpaced our GDP growth . 
the CP - 140 maritime patrol aircraft , the Aurora , must receive an update so that Canada can maintain its only strategic airborne surveillance platform .

this is why we must fight this unforgivable excess , which takes away too many innocent lives . 
they have expressed very clearly to me that they are adamantly and fundamentally opposed to the treaty as written . 
while the member talks about this doom and gloom scenario , we should recognize the huge progress that we have made and the progress we will make in the future . 
i should like to pay tribute to those who really deserve such tributes . 
but that is how Quebec entered the federation .

i finally figured out why this argument has been so forcefully put by the present government . 
honourable senators , I would feel much better about the minister ' s position if I knew he agreed that there has been an ingestion of a chemical that has nothing to do with producing stress but everything to do with producing real illnesses .

Mr. Svend J . Robinson 
probably he too looks at the polls relating to the Bloc Quebecois members and the rise in popularity of his leader , which has gone up constantly for the past year and a half . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :

Windsor is proud of its heritage as Canada ' s car capital . 
canada has been recognized for six straight years by the UN as the best country in the world in which to live . 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton , NDP ) :

i think this is extremely sad for the democratic process that is an elections act . 
i have thought of two people who as young adults were diagnosed with leukemia and who are still living . 
we hope the new parliament will take steps to respond to our entreaties to let those people go . 
i believe that voters will be very critical of members who rise in this House and do not recognize that the principle of equality between individuals applies to all citizens and that this equality should be the focus of our concerns . 
they include the costs of the governing council , the president ' s office , core secretariat costs , including costs for financial and information systems and rents , and costs of managing and administering research programs .

some hon. members : 
over the past six years the federal government has endeavoured to provide families with support in caring for their children . 
we have circumscribed much more carefully the amount of money that can be spent to influence voters . 
i listened to the debate and thought about what this bills means and there are some serious concerns in my mind which I would like to express to the House . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I am pleased to present a petition that has been certified correct as to form and content . 
that , in the opinion of this House , the government should bring in legislation limiting solely to individuals the right to donate to a federal political party , and restricting such donations to a maximum of $ 5,000 a year .

i would suggest that this is a matter of debate and that the hon. member has recourse to debate .

it should be noted that , for the past five years already , Quebec has had a law protecting personal information . 
however , I would enjoy exploring the issue with the hon. member at any time in the future .

the Speaker : 
senator Grafstein cannot understand me and I cannot understand the Honourable Senator Austin on this position . 
i know the hon. member for Regina - Qu ' Appelle , in his most bombastic style , is being perhaps a little provocative and is causing some uproar in the House , but the Speaker has to be able to hear the remarks of the hon. member who has the floor .

the Hon. the Speaker : 
the next question is on Motion No. 129 . Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
there must be a way to consider what a self - employed worker would do for a candidate , as a volunteer , outside working hours . 
madam Speaker , the Speech from the Throne clearly indicates that children are the highest priority of the government . 
the knowledge based industries which will provide the jobs of the future require access to a diverse range of skills close at hand to support them . 
chronic geological problems , productivity levels that were below industry standards , quality considerations , uncompetitive costs and pricing led the board of directors to some serious and unavoidable conclusions .

hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
it took 250 years to interpret a peace treaty signed with the aboriginals .

however , I can only conclude that the cabinet has not approved that item yet . 
i conclude by saying that my bill , contrary to similar bills debated in this House since 1992 , is a votable bill . 
it was the B.C. provincial Liberal Party which opposed the bill , while the soon to be ousted NDP government in B.C. rammed it through the B.C. legislature .

honourable senators , even as a result of the honourable senator ' s comments concerning the expanded scope of what he has contemplated , has the honourable senator given any consideration to allowing this matter to die ?

Mr. Speaker , the hon. members may have exaggerated the press reports a bit with their stories of billions of dollars .

Mr. Speaker , again I inform the member that a great number of variations regarding deals with various ports under the Canadian Ports Authority have been established . 
is any of that being done ? 
i am asking whether the government feels itself somewhat bound by that precedent ? 
Mr. Speaker , it would take a lot more than that . 
may be stated generally that any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions , or which obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty , or which has a tendency , directly or indirectly , to produce such results may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence .

the next question is Motion No. 18 . 
honourable senators , the issue the honourable senator raises with respect to procurement serves to illustrate how complicated the process normally is .

i ask him whether he shares my view that the government should have been much quicker to introduce a bill such as this , because Canada has now acquired an international reputation for trailing behind in research .

Mr. Speaker , the hon. member who just spoke suggested that perhaps the official opposition should thank the government for allowing the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development to travel to British Columbia . 
another reality is that the Government of Canada recognized the existing rights of aboriginal peoples in the 1982 Constitution Act , following a Canada - wide consultation . 
that is how much it is spending to give the biggest facelift in history to the revenue department . 
it has taken an opposition party , the Bloc Quebecois , to bring forward this motion , and it will take the justice committee I suppose to get some action by this government .

we have a certain reservation that our funding levels under this particular research program will remain disproportionate to funding in the United States and other industrialized countries which put a much higher premium on research and development . 
Canadians of all colours and religions are entering that circle . 
i wondered whether this could be the case . 
fortunately the people who were busy trying to do it were too busy to get discouraged .

Mr. Speaker , on Sunday , a large crowd gathered in Saint - Denis - sur - Richelieu to celebrate the Journ é e nationale des patriotes , which is held on the Sunday closest to November 23 , the anniversary of the battle of Saint - Denis - sur - Richelieu , which ended by a Patriots ' victory , in 1837 . 
if we had $ 1 million and it was on the table and we decided to spend that at $ 1,000 a day , in about three years or a little less , it would be gone .

the bill can be summed up as follows . 
we have terrific people who work in them and we have two quality airlines . 
as the Minister for International Trade has stated , we are committed to doing so and we are putting shipbuilding subsidies on the priority list of the upcoming negotiations in Seattle , Washington . 
i would like to divide my comments into two parts . 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
i would argue that the suspension of the Competition Bureau ' s activities on the Onyx proposal should be considered an admission of failure by the government to lead and to actually provide some visionary restructuring to the Canadian airlines industry a lot sooner . 
some hon. members : 
as stated in Mr. Justice Richard ' s report , there was a strong indication that the Westray management was aware of the levels of methane underground , which the coal miners were exposed to , and that these levels of methane were very hazardous and potentially explosive .

it is our belief that no serious disruption will occur in any of the locations served by Inter - Canadian Airlines .

i am eagerly anticipating Senator Prud ' homme ' s response .

with winter fast approaching , more and more families face the daunting task of trying to find shelter . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe 
we were happy to have those workers being employed , often for low wages , so that in the industrial urbanized areas , particularly in Ontario , people could earn a good income in the processing industries .

it was 12 years ago that Ren é L é vesque , one of Quebec ' s most prominent political figures , died . 
is there unanimous consent of the House for the hon. member to table that document ? 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) : 
i acknowledge the several references to facilitating , for example , electronic commerce and access to the Internet , but these do not constitute a comprehensive vision to secure Canada ' s future . 
these are the building blocks for further international co - operation which will ensure that culture is a key consideration on the international agenda . 
next time , in order to avoid a debate like the one we have been having today , he might suggest to his ministers that the bill include provisions to make it transparent , unlike the goings on at the present time in Human Resources Development . 
the minister says this House has allocated $ 900 million to help farmers . 
we can go back to the pipeline debate a number of years ago that went on for days and weeks and months because it was a right of Canadians , no matter how small their group in the House , to debate a bill until it was fully debated and fully discussed , so the people of eastern Canada can understand what is the problem with the legislation in British Columbia . 
i am thankful for being a Canadian . 
that was not a recommendation at all . 
when politicians say one thing and do another , that is the end of their credibility . 
i say to all first nations in Canada and in Quebec that , should they need the support of the Bloc Quebecois in moving toward autonomy , they can always count on us .

it happened with a very concerted effort and with the co - operation of Canadians from coast to coast . 
the act will abolish the process of vouching to reduce the risks of electoral fraud , a practice whereby rural voters could vouch for neighbours at the polling place so that they would be allowed to vote even when they had not been enumerated . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :

i wonder if the member can acknowledge that all this work is being done . 
those who have claimed refugee status are being given a fair hearing on an accelerated basis and in accordance with our charter , our international obligations and our proud humanitarian traditions .

the inflammatory remarks of the member for Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine on a day set aside to denounce violence of any form showed her blind partisanship .

the same area , according to fisheries and oceans , could fall under different categories and be subject to different regulations . 
the Senate ' s powers in respect of this particular bill are huge . 
it should not be addressed when it is attached to so much controversy , this bid and that bid , and all the accusations that are being made .

madam Speaker , the government has been entirely clear and transparent in its approach of using the Competition Tribunal , not only while the section 47 order is in place , but in the future .

honourable senators , during the work of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Bill C - 69 , we took a very close look at this issue . 
the recently announced partnership between the centre and the Insurance Council of Canada to reduce auto theft is welcome but not surprising . 
as a servant of the House , the Speaker has to ensure that the Standing Orders are respected and that the procedure applied by the government or the opposition is in accordance with the Standing Orders . 
Mr. Speaker , I would remind the leader of the government that if the committee on Bill 99 is not travelling , it is the fault of the Quebec Liberals . 
bill C - 20 is based on the false assumption that Quebecers can be identified as either separatists or federalists , when in fact the majority are deeply committed to Quebec without in the least reducing their attachment to Canada .

we are lucky to have such a world class institution in our community . 
it strikes me as prudent for the government to refer any such regulations to the Supreme Court of Canada . 
Mr. Speaker , as you well know , I could probably fill the entire day of debate on some of the things that the Reform in general have been doing and I , in particular , have been doing .

the Minister of Finance ' s economic statement is consistent with what the government has said all along , that the Canadian economy is very strong and our finances are very sound . 
the key question for this commission is where the influence came for the RCMP to undertake the actions which they did . 
premier Doer of Manitoba and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy have likewise expressed their concern about the Devil ' s Lake project .

Mr. Speaker , I welcome the opportunity to add my voice in support of Bill C - 23 . 
Mr. Speaker , I take it , in referring to the bad decision , the hon. member supported those bank mergers . 
instead of doing something in areas it was mandated to do something , the government intervenes in an area of pure civil rights tradition , thus compromising , as you can understand , the integrity of the powers of the national assembly . 
bill S - 2 , the short title of which is the Medical Decisions Facilitation Act , is the third bill of its kind to be introduced to this chamber in recent years .

Mr. Speaker , we are presently in negotiations with the Gitksan . 
as for the fact that it will be possible to amend legislation , if necessary , what message does this send for other private transactions ? 
they do not say to the Nisga ' a people " We understand that for 100 years you have tried to negotiate with Victoria . 
i wish to respond to that issue .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
start I saw a reduction to 6,000 deployed strategic warheads on both sides . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
this system is nothing less than the next generation Canadarm , which would help assemble and maintain the space station once in orbit 
it is very difficult , as the minister in the other place has suggested , to deny that this is a substantive precedent . 
why are these children not entitled to bread and dignity ? 
the fire alarm bells having sounded : ] 
its sidekick in Quebec , the Liberal Party , has said the same thing . 
a clear majority vote in Quebec on a clear question in favour of secession would confer democratic legitimacy on the secession initiative which all of the other participants in Confederation would have to recognize . 
is the government prepared to accept responsibility for the eventual disappearance of farm businesses because of the flaws in AIDA ? 
Mr. Eric Lowther 
yesterday the minister could not explain how a $ 750,000 grant became a $ 2 million cheque to a Liberal supporter . 
Canadians are not a boastful people . 
we brought these grassroots people together in a place in the middle of Winnipeg in a place called Birds Hill . 
hon. Nicholas W . Taylor :

we hope this new structure will incorporate the advice and active involvement of all so - called stakeholders in the medical research field , including academic researchers , researchers in the private sector , in pharmaceutical companies and in other health care companies , and researchers in government agencies and departments . 
today , we as legislators have the opportunity to grant specific rights , and we will do so if we adopt the treaty that is now before us . 
it has met with the recently departed Secretary General of NATO and other senior officials . 
madam Speaker , on a point of order . 
the people of Ontario do not even get a balanced budget in return for the destruction of their social fabric . 
natural HEALTH PRODUCTS 
it is an unjustifiable excuse and the government may not use it . 
it is a challenge that the Government of Canada is attempting to meet in a constructive way through the many programs offered by the department . 
this is where we come back to the concept of judge and company . 
hon. Fernand Robichaud : 
we are not to go around behind each other ' s backs with little pieces of information we can use against one another . 
i served in the provincial legislature for a term and now I am here .

as my colleague has mentioned , what we are talking about is that the government has funded this corporation and clearly and obviously has run this corporation into the ground and has now decided to walk away . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
using the modified aboriginal right approach , the Nisga ' a aboriginal rights , including title , continue to exist , although only as modified , to have the attributes and geographic extent set out in the Nisga ' a Final Agreement . 
however , to better deal with transgressions of the act that occur during election campaigns , the Commissioner of Elections will be able to enter into compliance agreements and seek injunctions with respect to offenders . 
that is what the Senate decided . 
let me cover some of the major changes . 
as a matter a fact , in the last two budgets , when we were in a surplus , we cut taxes by $ 16.5 billion over three years . 
i encourage all Canadians to support and embrace Bill C - 18 . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
is the House ready for the question ? 
without wanting to compare communities , because I do not think that is fair , I can say that the degree of local leadership shown in that community and in the neighbouring communities proved to me that the best ideas , the most substantive and substantial ideas , come from the people themselves . 
at the end of last year a friend of mine who worked in Uganda was confronted by a group of women who were walking along a roadway . 
we want to do all these things and it is difficult to balance everything . 
it is a fact that several of the professional and institutional organizations indicated that they already had privacy codes that made those of us on the committee optimistic to the fact that it should be possible , within the 24 months , to develop out of these various privacy codes a consensus set of codes that would apply to the health care sector . 
we should be doing much more and Canadians deserve much more . 
limits are being put on the number of witnesses by political party . 
Canadians have watched the government lead the country from a nation of despair to a nation of success . 
the Hockey Hall of Fame as of today is Wayne ' s world . 
the idea that this place or the nine justices down the street will wake up one day and say that marriage is over after eons of civilization is slightly paranoid . 
hon. George S . Baker 
that is outstanding in my view . 
[ later ] 
it was the 66 th anniversary of the famine genocide on the Ukrainian population which took place in 1933 . 
i want to thank the member for St. Paul ' s for taking the initiative of raising this very important issue in the House . 
motion No. 416 negatived 
honourable senators , I do not think it can be accomplished overnight . 
parliament has been darkened by the performance of the minister and the government in this regard . 
the province of British Columbia is subject to aboriginal land claims . 
these projects were not chosen because they were suspect ; they were picked statistically at random . 
the problem was that she left out the homes . 
it is hard to expect high standards from ministers when their boss is breaking the rules left , right and centre . 
unless the majority in this chamber acts , it will be during our watch that the Senate of Canada ceased to be an important part of the checks and balances which kept Canada a parliamentary democracy . 
it encompasses one of Canada ' s major high technology clusters centred in but not restricted to the city of Kanata . 
the government has actually continued to plunder Canadians through the back door while pretending to provide some level of tax relief through the front door . 
that is why Treasury Board conducted a review . 
there is a very good reason for this . 
government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Beno î t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) : 
* * * 
to what extent there were further discussions , if any , I am not aware at the moment . 
in addition to this amount , the delegation ' s request was for another $ 1.3 billion . 
however , it is not for the Bloc Quebecois to impose themes or exhibit material on museums . 
that is why we in the NDP want to put this debate about the WTO and about these trade agreements in the context of the ongoing debate about democracy . 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
it has expanded to lobster . 
i also was fully aware , because of the mandate , that SIRC had a mandate from the House to evaluate the situation and had access to CSIS files . 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
motion No. 1 
with respect to the specific question raised by the honourable senator , obviously , the final decisions with regard to the reserves will be made by the Department of National Defence . 
the Mexican government is continuing , according to foreign observers , to seriously infringe on human rights and manifestly lacks the political will to reach a peaceful solution . 
when Senator Austin spoke on Bill C - 9 before Christmas , he described our role as follows : 
division No. 670 
it is a fee for service operation where smugglers are paid for simple passage across international borders . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
when will he tell us about the status of the search for the missing CSIS documents ? 
some people would suggest it is within the power of the band or the minister to decide if they want to have title to the property but they do not have the right to have title to the property . 
library OF PARLIAMENT 
if the hon. member checks Hansard he will see that I was also forthcoming about administrative problems with that program ; but with regard to the internal audit , that is about the grants and contributions in seven large programs , and that information I received on November 17 . 
united Nations 
Mr. Peter Stoffer 
honourable senators , under Canada ' s Constitution neither the federal Parliament and its government nor the provincial legislatures and their governments are expressly given the power to cede or vacate powers to another legislative body , and certainly not to a legislative body which is not recognized in the Canadian Constitution of 1982 . 
there are 12 in my bill , consistent with what we do here in the House . 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) :

Mr. Gordon Earle 
" 20.1 ( 1 ) On the expiration of six years after the coming into force of this Act , the provisions contained herein shall be referred to such committee of both Houses of Parliament as may be designated or established by Parliament for that purpose . 
Mr. Speaker , how can the parliamentary secretary refuse to confirm these facts , when I talked yesterday with assistant deputy minister Danielle Vincent , who confirmed them . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
it is our intention to again support it . 
again that would be their decision . 
no , I am sorry . 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 350 , an act to provide for the use of a maximum speed control device for use on motor vehicles and to prohibit the manufacture and sale of motor vehicles that are not equipped with a maximum speed control device . 
when it comes to the Canadian Wheat Board , the member must be reminded that the wheat board only operates under the confines of federal legislation that restricts farmers from selling wheat and barley on export except through the board . 
notice of Motion to Form Special Senate Committee 
i would also like to thank Canadians from coast to coast , right across Canada , who have supported this bill . 
according to statistics , more than half a billion people in the world are disabled as a result of mental , physical or sensory impairments . 
i listened to Senator Kinsella ' s presentation , and paid particular heed to the part about the country being indivisible and the part where he said that we cannot use force to keep Canada together . 
we are looking at very important principles with respect to the support of the treaty . 
is it the government ' s agenda to give natives unlimited access to all natural resources in the country ? 
i have enclosed a copy of my two most recent pay stubs . 
if this is correct , the federal cabinet must ask the CRTC to assume its responsibilities toward Canada ' s francophone minority . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 177 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
on the issue of voter identification it is the current practice that an elected official , who has doubts about a voter ' s identity or right to vote , may ask the person for proof of ID and residence . 
why do they want to do that ? 
why not let Jean Charest and the Liberal Party of Quebec fight the battle and remind the present Government of Quebec that - 
we have to rush it through the House , do we not ? 
Mr. Speaker , I have here a document which my friends across the way will certainly find interesting . 
honourable senators , when shall this report be taken into consideration ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i did not refer to the Senate as such because others in the caucus will . 
we do not believe in special status for English or French . 
NISGA ' A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
on that fundamental issue , there is no disagreement . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl 
coming out of that meeting the minister indicated that Cairns members had agreed to a common WTO negotiating front , namely , freer , fairer and more market oriented trade conditions . 
this was electioneering . 
the adoption of the Nisga ' a final agreement will send a clear signal that we as a society are ready to build new relationships based on mutual trust , respect and understanding . 
i will not read them all because I have a few pages of quotes from witnesses at committee , including the civil servants who deal in this area , where they admit that , no , they cannot really enforce it . 
it brings into existence a mechanism which would allow the minister to test his particular orientation and also that of his officials so they could look at the assessment being proposed and the amount of taxation being levelled against particular properties and make sure that the advice has the benefit of consultation and expertise . 
i am sure there is no other reason whatsoever . 
hon. Paul Martin 
years ago , Senator Nolin and I foresaw this danger . 
Mr. Speaker , an article from the December 11 issue of The Gazette questions the fact that under the bill to be tabled today a no will have more weight than a yes . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
the second area involves amendments that would make the English and French versions consistent . 
the Speaker :

in the interest of advancing human rights , we all have a responsibility to make sure that new technologies respect the values of a civil society , among which is the protection of our privacy rights . 
" force on May 1 , 2005 " 
agreed . 
i also do not have any trouble understanding it coming from the Conservatives down on the other side of us because the red Tories are almost exactly the same thing as what we have sitting here as the NDP . 
there are no accusations . 
i bring to the member ' s attention the case of Dr. Chopra , who was one of the scientists who testified on the shredding of documents which had to do with the BST hormone issue . 
what is the purpose of having somebody policing his boss ? 
it is at its lowest since 1981 .

i am sure I will have the occasion to provide more citations in the questions to follow . 
i would like to be obliging to the member who has asked for us to rise to our feet to respond . 
Mr. Dick Proctor 
i say again in the context of the transitional jobs fund and the Canada jobs fund , they have made a difference in my riding . 
they have no respect whatsoever for the partnership forged throughout our common history . 
division No. 553 
members 
we are more democratic in Canada than most of the countries of the world . 
Mr. Speaker , it is always difficult to follow the member for Saint John . 
it does not matter what number we put on it . 
why should Canadian workers believe any of these promises on tax relief when the federal deduction from their paycheques week after week and month after month keeps increasing rather than decreasing ? 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
internal Economy , Budgets and Administration 
they disrespect the entire contingent of people in the official opposition who have concerns about it and who would like to see a different process that we would hope would clarify some of the 50 unsettled sidebar agreements that have to go into the Nisga ' a agreement . 
given this contradicts everything the minister said would not happen , including the child pornography case reaching the supreme court , would the parliamentary secretary tell us if the government will now invoke the notwithstanding clause ? 
with all due respect to my committee colleagues , we would have benefited from having a noted constitutional law expert like Conservative Senator G é rald Beaudoin asking questions of these benefits . 
i will go back to a comment made by the parliamentary secretary when he talked about national railways . 
senator Lewis has been a long - time , dedicated and hard - working member of the scouting community , a passion we both share . 
this is gross mismanagement and possibly negligence . 
it is clear that Canada needs tourism and that we should market our wonderful country abroad , but it is not clear that we need a crown corporation to carry out that activity . 
oftentimes Canadians wonder what we can do , as opposed to the rest of the world , and we need not look any further than those two carriers to see Canada excelling in the airline transport industry . 
the fact of the matter is there is chaos in the minister ' s department . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
they claim that they had been cheated out of much of their traditional territory . 
we are respecting that commitment . 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
that is the wonderful privilege of public service . 
in provinces like Ontario there is no one but the federal government that can make a real impact on homelessness . 
i spoke to many crown attorneys on this issue . 
honourable senators , later in the afternoon , I will be addressing that specific issue in my speech . 
honourable senators , previously in speeches here I had discussed the 1995 Civil Justice Review of Ontario , co - chaired by Justice Blair . 
we could have made a difference . 
finally , honourable senators , I would add that the first duty of senators is to defend each other ' s right to speak , not to be on the floor trying to find a reason to pass judgment on another senator because the senator was not quick - witted enough , fast enough on his feet , smart enough , clever enough , kind enough or charitable enough to say something different or better . 
it is a cause for concern , therefore , that Canada is failing to meet its targets for landed immigrants . 
the Speaker : 
we all know of the auto pact decision . 
i have reminded the House before that the forms that the hon. member is referring to are , yes , seven pages long . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
but he missed the point . 
Mr. Ken Krawetz , the finance critic of the Official Opposition in Saskatchewan , blamed the current farm income crisis on the provincial government . 
one of the things that varies in the proposals in the Speech from the Throne is that we actually have a blueprint for five years . 
if only one fact could be cited , which should be sufficient evidence in itself to prompt the government to greater action , it is the fact cited in the motion that combined realized net income for farmers in Manitoba and Saskatchewan is down 98 % from the previous five year average . 
it being 12 o ' clock midnight the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) . 
surrounded on three sides by water , one would think that Canada could have a viable , thriving and prosperous shipbuilding industry .

why does the Reform Party not want to let the commission do its work and respect the work being done by former Mr. Justice Hughes ? 
the Competition Bureau will indeed very much be at play in whatever happens . 
it was not directly related to the act , but it does have to do with the overall operation of the House . 
i think it is fitting that I should be given the opportunity on her behalf to welcome to our chamber her two granddaughters , Maija and Micka , who are sitting in the gallery with their father , Michael Pearson , who is named after a very famous grandfather .

the Liberal government has clearly failed to fix the broken immigration system . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
the government should have the courage to rewrite its tax tables and say openly that it wants to increase the progressiveness of personal income tax because that is what it is doing anyway in its roundabout fashion . 
in his motion the hon. member for Skeena raises a number of interesting points that should be taken into account in the government ' s ongoing review of the Privacy Act . 
is this what he really said ? 
presumably , this means of Quebec and of the rest of Canada , but this is how the motion is worded . 
this is an aspect that should be examined by the committee , which could draw inspiration from the Quebec act and apply it maybe a little differently . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
an illegal trust fund was used to deliver the cash to the Prime Minister ' s friend . 
he chaired the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations over much of the course of this decade . 
they want to say to the government that placing the market ideology and the interests of transnational corporations above the interests of the people of Canada and what we should be doing as a democratically elected government is a very dangerous course and must be stopped .

Mr. Mac Harb : 
Mr. Speaker , for years I have said that one does not break up a country after a judicial recount . 
i believe that the insidiousness of organized crime just sits there and stirs the pot . 
the government has to realize that its very presence in a municipality generates costs for the whole community that it is not prepared to assume . 
as any person will say , it is the height of folly not to admit when one has made a mistake . 
in fact , the opposite has taken place .

in order to speed up the process let us please try to have a little more decorum around here . 
the bigger principle involved is stepping back and taking a look at the principle in agreement and the problems with it . 
no account has been taken of what I mentioned earlier concerning the tourism development policy of Quebec , which held a tourism forum in 1997 . 
his comment was " Don ' t worry about it . 
i find it baffling that the NDP is suggesting that we not pursue trade liberalization when farmers would be on Canada ' s list of endangered species if it were not for free trade . 
in fact it was Prime Minister Laurier who turned back the clock of progress just 13 years later and undid the federal responsibility for the vote . 
the member gets up and pulls some obscure fact , if indeed it is a fact or not just something that is being fed by the spin doctors on his own party side , and claims that this undermines our position , a position being taken right now in the context of new developments .

i will focus my remarks on the funding of political parties , the appointment of election officers in the various ridings , the transparency of postal voting , equity , compliance with the Elections Act on which we will be voting democratically in this parliament , and the sacred principle of one person one vote . 
national DEFENCE 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa . 
we know that without those things children have no reason to have input into their community . 
the 1991 school dropout survey indicated that a high percentage of the dropouts were dissatisfied with both the variety of courses and their usefulness . 
what we need are solutions . 
from 1996 to 1999 seniors lost $ 20 million from the scam cards . 
i was asked to go as part of the committee . 
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Ref. ) : 
members can stand if they want , but what the member said is inaccurate because there is a change in the bill which addresses that issue . 
canada ELECTIONS ACT 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
who voted for it ? 
most lawyers who looked at the case said they would not touch it . 
this is the Liberals ' style of co - operative federalism . 
i would hope so . 
when it came to taxes , the previous government knew where to collect them and it called them taxes . 
national DEFENCE 
he was a great Canadian and the scope and breadth of Mr. Macnaughton ' s professional activities were impressive . 
they need to know that . 
quite often if the tone is constructive , then there is a willingness on this side of the House to resolve these issues . 
i have even read in one of the briefs that they believe that this would prevent Blue Cross and Green Shield from carrying out the responsibilities that they carry out in Ontario with respect to the health care system . 
let us not forget that , under the 1995 GATT agreement , the signatories pledged to reduce their farm subsidies by 15 % . 
Mrs. Monique Guay 
i did not realize until today that the member we are paying tribute to , Mr. Gleave , was a seatmate of the member for Regina - Qu ' Appelle . 
with 150 Canadians dying every year waiting for a transplant and with one of the worst donor rates in the entire developed world , it took the government four months to respond , during which time 66 Canadians died . 
Ms. Paddy Torsney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
i recall that at the first meeting of the Committee on Human Resources Development , the year following the 1997 election , there were members of the NDP , the Progressive Conservative Party and the Bloc Quebecois who asked that the first issue the committee were to consider be the EI reform . 
for the leader of the Reform Party to suggest otherwise , I believe , is a misrepresentation . 
we believe that Canadians are smart enough to analyze the information with which they are presented during an election period . 
Mr. Mac Harb 
i have nothing against that , but we have been asking for reviews for seven years . 
Mr. Chapman went on to state :

the first type of traveller may be a business person who must get from point A to point B , for example from Baie - Comeau to Montreal . 
they are so busy cashing CNR and CPR dividend cheques that they do not have the interests of the farmers at heart . 
in our opinion , the process is working , and working fine . 
Mr. Speaker , a few days ago , the Government of Canada took part in the inauguration of La V é rendrye boulevard west in the city of Gatineau . 
though the Senate ' s role has evolved and changed since Confederation , I do have a great deal of sympathy for those who would see the Senate as a final hurdle or backstop against those who would destroy our country . 
of course , prevention is good , but when a young person has committed an offence , rehabilitation becomes essential to ensure the long term safety of the community and to ensure that we have a citizen who will work with us toward social objectives , instead of having one who will be in and out of jail all his life . 
before I begin I would like to thank many witnesses who took the time to make submissions , either in person or in writing , to the Standing Committee on Industry . 
for example , we must stop squabbling over the gun control legislation , for the Mini - 14 that was used on them 10 years ago is still not banned . 
absence of an official poverty line makes it difficult to hold the federal , provincial and territorial governments accountable with respect to their obligations under the Covenant .

in terms of the farm crisis , there is not one member on this side of the House who needs any lesson in dealing with that crisis . 
madam Speaker , it is a privilege to stand in the House to speak on Bill C - 13 , an act to establish Canadian Institutes of Health Research and an act to repeal the Medical Research Council Act . 
honourable senators , I have said on several occasions that I think the government and the Parliament that passes this bill can take some considerable pride in it . 
Mr. Speaker , when one takes a hard look at how certain ministers of this government have squandered billions of dollars , one wonders about the government ' s integrity . 
he has been an activist and a conscience of the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia and the Liberal Party of Canada . 
strangely enough , suddenly the Reform Party is greatly concerned about agricultural issues . 
the Quebec elections act prohibits corporate donations . 
because the industry minister has introduced this piece of legislation without any consultation with the provinces or anybody else . 
this man had a son , his only son , Robert Stephenson , who became famous in his own right . 
that would show people we represent that we take globalization very seriously . 
i would remind the hon. member concerned , however , that his party was in office during the crucial period of nine years almost immediately after the adoption of the charter of rights , which included the saving of aboriginal rights still to be defined by virtue of sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . 
madam Speaker , I ask that all remaining Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers be allowed to stand . 
what we are saying to the New Democratic Party and every party in the House is that they can bring any witnesses they want before the committee and we will listen to all their opinions . 
i remind the member for Brandon - Souris that GRIP was abandoned because those two provinces did not want GRIP . 
finally , schedule 4 must include corporations that make money . 
he stated , " I accept the general thrust of your argument and it is something we have to work toward as we progressively get the books in order '' .

that is precisely what I spoke about . 
it just so happens that some time ago the auditor general presented one of the quarterly reports . 
we would like to see the criminal code amended to ensure that corporate executives and directors are held properly accountable for workplace safety .

Mr. Alex Shepherd 
why is it that the U.S. energy secretary can find 17 things to do to help Americans , but the Prime Minister cannot think of one thing to help Canadians ? 
instead , it continues to limit . 
both parties have agreed to work together to develop new work rules to serve customers better and face the competition posed by new technologies and multinational corporations . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
it took the Minister of Health months to respond to the health care committee , and during the course of that month , in October , roughly 66 people died in the country while waiting for the minister to respond . 
several years later , while I was leader of the party , we were fortunate enough to have a sufficient number of members elected to allow us to become the Official Opposition . 
support programs were removed .

we also need to know what causes the disease and why it affects some people but not others . 
Japan , which has had its share of problems with organized crime , has taken steps that have helped , I would not say to eradicate the problem - because it is not true and I would not want to imply that it is - but to control the progression of biker gangs . 
i clearly indicate , as I do in Canada , that the appointment of returning officers under the present system is an anachronism . 
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to present the 40 th annual report of a meeting of the Canada - United States Interparliamentary Group which took place in Quebec City from May 20 to 24 . 
if , however , the government is planning to provide more grants and bursaries , or some serious debt remission , then I would view this promise in a much more positive light . 
the Speaker : 
i have read several reports of a task force set up by the former Clerk of the Privy Council to prepare Canada for 2005 , and several references are made to Canadians ' serious identity problem . 
Mr. John Solomon : 
that is a tremendous opportunity for co - operation from both sides . 
they put on more employment insurance investigators while at the same time , at the other end of the system , there was no monitoring . 
hon. W . David Angus : 
i want to re - emphasize to members of the opposition that this is not a constitutional amendment . 
i would want the debate to include the question of whether preserving the 10 % limit is part of the consideration of the public interest . 
through access to information we have learned two conflicting versions of the Scotia Rainbow story . 
we have already done so once before in this session during our replies to the Speech from the Throne , a speech in which the government completely failed to even acknowledge the problem . 
on the prairies , trade is responsible for the majority of producer income . 
this shows the kind of work that can happen when there is unanimity and agreement on vital issues such as this . 
if that argument holds here , why was it not applied in Term 17 , when we were involved with the process right from the beginning ? 
honourable senators , one - in - five Canadians will suffer from mental illness in their lifetime .

i invite the lady to read the testimony . 
Mr. Jay Hill : 
naturally , it would still be up to the National Assembly to decide whether or not to adopt it , but it would be interesting for Quebecers to be consulted .

right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
the biggest waste of money in the House is the appropriations for research for the other opposition parties . 
in the past decade , honourable senators , the government has drastically reduced funding to the provinces for the basic necessities - dollars that provided for social services , decent housing , health care and education . 
our congratulations to the coaches , players and all the volunteers who made this victory possible . 
the hon. member for Broadview - Greenwood gave this clear answer regarding the 50 % plus one rule " Personally , I would say that , if the question were clear , we would begin the negotiation process '' . 
leave was granted , but as soon as the motion was under debate there was some confusion about the nature of the proceedings . 
between November 14 and November 19 I had the opportunity to go to British Columbia with the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development , which held hearings on the Nisga ' a agreement . 
there are some people who need to make decisions about investing in a boat this winter . 
in this way we underline the principles of fairness and equity so that they are upheld . 
the federal government must not designate any CIHRs in Quebec without the approval of the provincial government .

will the minister not acknowledge that the purely academic debate over a theoretical percentage , which he wants to be different from the way things are , is a desperate measure to come up with a way to avoid the constitutional obligation to negotiate the Supreme Court of Canada set for the government ? 
that is the referendum mentality . 
this goes to show how important fishing and this wheel is to the Nisga ' a . 
we continue to have very good dialogue with the provinces , the farm organizations and the national safety nets advisory committee that is meeting in Ottawa again this week to assist us in this challenge and this opportunity .

honourable senators , in view of the response of the Honourable Leader of the Government about grants going to opposition parties , I feel compelled to rise and ask him about the member for Winnipeg Centre , Pat Martin . 
it is one thing to debate and have an intelligent criticism , but it is something quite different to deliberately manufacture and peddle misinformation and completely false allegations about this treaty . 
it is a straightforward and direct attempt to achieve reconciliation in cases of potential marriage breakdown and subsequent divorce .

why did the government not set figures , rules , percentages and thresholds in its legislation ? 
i hope the hon. member does not need what he just tore up . 
the Hon. the Acting Speaker : 
the committee has decided in its own right to remain in Ottawa . 
if we believe in a system of fairness as I believe Canadians do , then we must ensure that the system is transparent . 
i cannot believe that if they were willing to testify at that time that they would not be more willing to appear before a committee now , three years later , and finally be given a chance to give their side of the story . 
the government has virtually ignored all the work of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs . 
accordingly , I feel that given the past practice of the House and given the fact that the House is master of its own procedure , I do not believe the House is bound by proceedings in the courts until the court has made a ruling that binds the House . 
transitional JOBS FUND 
more important , I look forward to the committee process , wherein I would envisage further study and debate . 
the next question is on Motion No. 169 .

in short , plan B was the stick while plan A , which we have heard little about , was supposed to be the carrot , a very small , transparent , translucent , genetically engineered carrot we have not often seen .

in fact , the construction was started back in 1993 - 94 and completed in approximately 1995 . 
i wanted to get clarification on whether he meant that the WTO and the NAFTA agreement would have no binding relationship to culture in the country any longer . 
honourable senators , Senator Beaudoin drew our attention not only to section 27 of our Charter , which mandates that all rights within our Charter must be interpreted in a manner consistent with our multicultural heritage , but he also drew our attention to international human rights instruments . 
maybe it needs speed reading courses because Judge Evans ' decision is crystal clear . 
we have to provide the support necessary for the child through the educational system , the family system and society as a whole . 
that means Canada is the place to be for artists , among others . 
furthermore , the Minister of National Defence should commit to Canadians that he will do everything in his power to ensure that NATO fully complies with the UN Balkan environmental task force investigation into depleted uranium use in Kosovo . 
honourable senators , the host country , Australia , was generous and warm in the hospitality shown to all of us - even though they were unable to show us a kangaroo in the wild , which caused some of us deep regret .

the reaction throughout was a belief that the compromises that led to the approval of the federation and the belief that French Canadian rights were the same across the country had been betrayed . 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
the Senate Transport and Communications report will , no doubt , be tabled in the very near future . 
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government ' s intentions relating to parental leave as they are set out in the throne speech put the proposed changes off until 2001 .

honourable senators , notwithstanding our stated foreign policy of constructive engagement , which we have had an opportunity to speak on from time to time in this chamber , we are dealing in this instance with a bilateral relationship . 
there is another point I would like to make . 
we believe that Bill C - 9 offers what is possible and will increase the momentum to negotiate , which is critical to the social stability and economic progress that all British Columbians seek .

the study was prepared in 1988 and is entitled " A Comparison of the Bill of Rights and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms '' . 
Mr. Speaker , quite frankly , I am not very interested in creating employment through researching the issue of drugs in prisons .

the amendments just read to the House were three of those technical amendments contained within Group No. 2 . Because we did not yet have full agreement among all the parties in the House to the introduction of all of the technical amendments , we thought we should deal with the three in Group No. 2 . 
that does not say very much for the employment creation capabilities of government - owned companies .

i raised the issue of jointly finding a way to implement some of the recommendations of our report with the then leader of the government in the Senate , the Honourable Joyce Fairbairn , but those discussions led nowhere . 
all of us are very proud of the contribution of Julie Payette and other scientists .

i can see he is avoiding answering the question , and I can guess why . 
i am sure the hon. member meant to say Mr. Speaker instead of Paul , and I know he would want to do that in future . 
senator LeBreton has already done so , and I presume that other members of the committee will do so in the future . 
indeed , as I mentioned in parenthesis , there are many countries with which we have good relations - governments that operate without anything close to a 50 per cent , plus one support .

it being 2 o ' clock , I wonder if the House would give unanimous consent for the government to ask the official opposition questions for the next hour . 
but he did not . 
i believe the Speaker deemed it appropriate to include Motion No. 1 in the same group simply because the legislation currently regards volunteer labour provided by a self - employed person during an election as a contribution , and Motion No. 1 seeks to allow a self - employed person to participate in an election campaign without such participation necessarily being regarded as a contribution .

the finance department estimates that 1.6 % of couples are gay which would indicate some 140,000 homosexual couples . 
the Canadian Bar Association was its usual unhelpful self on this issue when they appeared before the House of Commons committee . 
this would inevitably lead to a very explosive situation . 
i think it would be a step in the right direction . 
nay .

Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is pushing on an open door .

i might add , Madam Speaker , that the government ' s response to these petitions so far has been less than satisfactory .

madam Speaker , I would like to enlarge upon the Newfoundland referendum a bit .

the report clearly shows that northerners support the development of a process that would reconsider the current oil and gas moratorium . 
the promises of a new approach , the promises of a new administration , are all in jeopardy now . 
some supported it but some did not . 
the government does a bit of tinkering to create the perception that it is doing something about an issue , when in fact , when we scratch under the surface and look at the brass tacks of how the legislation applies to people , the government does not change the problem substantively . 
there are no easy answers but I have confidence that there is a long term solution and that constructive dialogue is the way of shaping it .

the committee was right to say that the government had a negative attitude toward seasonal workers . 
is there unanimous consent of the House ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
shame ! 
i do not want to be told that we need to put more money into the department because the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is the only department that has had an increase in its budget every year since the government came into power . 
it has been a debate in the best traditions of this place . 
senator Kinsella : 
instead of having to outline their complaints to the minister of Indian affairs , they would have an independent ombudsman ' s office that would address their concerns . 
i remember my friend from Prince Edward Island when he was the national president of the farmers union based in Saskatoon . 
could the minister advise whether the government has any intention of recalling the Canadian ambassador to Austria in order to assess the appropriate unique Canadian response to the participation of Joerg Haider and his Freedom Party in the new Austrian coalition government ?

the next question is on Motion No. 210 . 
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour to rise today and speak to this important Bill C - 224 , an act which would direct the creation of a genocide exhibit at the Canadian Museum of Civilization . 
i welcome this change in terms of having one trial . 
did I understand correctly that for this one time only you will allow Motions Nos. 100 to 157 to stand individually but that in the future you want them in a single group , which in any case does not alter the present situation since these motions are all in Group No. 1 , which will be debated starting today ? 
agreed . 
my proposal is very simple and it does involve the gasoline and diesel tax . 
sections 2 , 4 , 14 et 20 come into force on March 18 , 2005 and the remaining provisions of this Act come into "

introduction and first reading 
why is the government hiking payroll taxes on January 1 ? 
these are just a few examples of the shortcomings of this . 
in short , Bill C - 4 implements our commitments under the international agreement by bringing Canadian legislation in line with that agreement . 
one of the real treats of my service here has been that I , too , have gained and enjoyed the friendship of Senator Lewis . 
that the Senate concur in the second report of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs presented to the Senate on November 2 , 1999 . 
Mr. Speaker , I do not believe anyone in the House would question the competence of the RCMP .

procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
my friend is in constant pain when he tries to get up from his chair to come to the door to let me in . 
it is Penelakut . 
he might have had something to say about Bill C - 20 . I could say the same for the member for Bourassa . 
i can see that the House is bubbling with energy to get on with the debate on the motion of the hon. Leader of the Opposition , and I respectfully suggest this is where we should go . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the third matter that comes to mind from the testimony of Mr. Desautels , which may be of interest to honourable senators is when he was asked if he had any views on why some of these problems may have arisen . 
this is common practice . 
to enlighten the House , I ask for unanimous consent to table this document . 
when we get into other groups it will be much more difficult to be closely confined . 
some hon. members : 
it is very confusing for Canadians . 
( division 303 ) 
perhaps the honourable senator will know whether there has been any change in that stance . 
motion No. 326 negatived 
i do not know how many times that has to be said in this place before someone will actually listen to the argument . 
that made it much easier to ignore their conditions . 
the NDP have sponsored an amendment , but the seconder is not in her seat . 
i appreciate the support that all members thus far have shown for this motion . 
on a matter of this critical importance to our province , to our country and our constitution , every member of parliament deserves an opportunity to speak . 
annual Report Tabled 
an Hon. Senator : 
the week we would have had in order to give advance notice was taken away from us by the opening of the House and the throne speech . 
he only wanted to table the report of an interparliamentary delegation . 
i am determined , from my position in the Senate and with the means at my disposal , to do everything to fuel the debate in a positive sense .

there is therefore no mention of the official signing ceremony marking the much - hated patriation of the Constitution in 1982 . 
to my knowledge , we were almost the only ones to oppose the bill . 
what are its objects ? 
that seems only fair and reasonable to me . 
the government must set firm , achievable debt reduction targets . 
if that was the case , and I could very easily have been wrong , it seems to me that the member should have made the point at that time . 
because the clerk missed one person , she actually forgave all of the other voters behind the individual who she did not recognize . 
i wish to point out that something might not have been made perfectly clear this morning during our party leader ' s first speech . 
the hon. member is here in the House with us . 
i have already cited several of these judgments and quoted the judges in my several speeches here .

Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
not only will it let citizens hold senators to account in a more effective way , it will also contribute to a heightened legitimacy of parliamentary institutions , this place known as the Parliament of Canada . 
Calder , Sparrow , Delgamuukw are all supreme court rulings that support aboriginals and thus give them specific rights . 
from there I want to review some of the history of the legislation , both the background and some of the most recent problems that have led to this new bill . 
in Quebec , we have a pharmacare program .

elections Canada has repeatedly asked the government to release it from the patronage system and allow it to hire its own staff for elections by advertising and interviewing based on ability , merit and experience . 
" returning officer recommended " 
hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
the only certainty that the Nisga ' a bill will bring is certainty of income for the lawyers . 
Canadians got a government which refuses to assume responsibility for the management of that money . 
i , however , am going to try to get the debate back to Bill C - 10 , back to the municipalities and to federal - provincial relations . 
that is an important issue when we talk about an agreement that has such an impact on the lives of people in British Columbia and , for that matter , across the country . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my friend for his question . 
agreed . 
we rank the applications hierarchically and I think it has been one of the factors in enabling us to present cases to ministers and to others for grants . 
i said that I would take it under advisement . 
it is not easy because we are dealing with human beings .

with the recent announcement , if the additional federal money that has been added since I have held this position were cost - shared on the normal 60 - 40 basis , it would have amounted to about $ 1.8 billion . 
order , please . 
we will not be able to say that we will completely ignore what is going on . 
we often hear today that people are turned off of politics . 
senator Comeau : 
the official is asked by the Department of Justice to make amendments and add new definitions to all the laws . 
suppose the national assembly decides to hold a referendum and prepares a question , and the House of Commons likes the question . 
motion No. 189 
in a 45 minute speech there was not one reference to the farm crisis despite the suffering , the pain , the demonstrations , the protests , the writings and the calls by the united front across Saskatchewan and Manitoba for extra assistance . 
Canadians do their part , but this deadly and challenging disease continues to take lives , and every life lost is a tragedy . 
i do not think the study of the bill would reach the depths that it should without those views . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
we would not have made these gains without making efforts to liberalize trade . 
they say : 
after the internal audit came to her attention , which is now a public record , a program was put in place to deal with it . 
if it is satisfied with the bill we will do what we can to help get it through to give the federation the security it wants on at least the issues addressed in Bill C - 10 . 
it is important that we also look at the examples of Japan and European countries in the EU which are also moving to reform regulatory burden issues within their countries . 
fisheries 
obviously , we do not want to cheer these young people for their wrongdoings , but we not want to turn them into criminals for life either . 
there already was a good example the government knew about . 
canada , therefore , is calling for an immediate ceasefire and for dialogue to begin as soon as possible with the elected representatives of the Chechnyan people . 
it would be much more beneficial if we acknowledged this need for ethical responsibility now rather than later . 
i look forward to that . 
Mr. Ren é Laurin 
the results of the consultation were subjected to careful analysis by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs .

i would urge all hon. members to give the bill due consideration and support . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 180 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
if that provision is in there , it may well be that the committee will need to seek an extension beyond November 18 . 
the Hon. the Speaker pro tempore : 
once so ratified , Start III would follow and reduce strategic weapons on both sides possibly to as low as 1,500 each , but more likely 2,000 - 2,500 . 
that is a summation of some of my concerns . 
several serious consequences could result from this project .

let us suppose there is a yes vote on a clear question .

Mr. Maurice Vellacott 
pulling off a Gitxsan - Gitanyow negotiator and moving him to the Nisga ' a and putting in sections 33 , 34 and 35 may not be a prejudice , but it is the appearance of prejudice that is damning . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Ron and I cemented our friendship in the last few years . 
this is serious discrimination against me as an MP and where my freedom of speech is compromised , like that of all the other members of this House .

that the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance be empowered to examine and report upon the expenditures set out in the Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2000 ; and 
the traditional nation - state was based on a single language , a single culture , a single religion . 
i will listen to the hon. member but I will ask him to be very brief . 
very briefly , honourable senators , these clauses state that third parties will be allowed to spend up to a total of $ 150,000 during an election . 
i am also saddened to see the way this Nisga ' a treaty conforms to the Liberal pattern of showing only respect , if one can even call it that , only to aboriginal band leadership and not showing the same respect for the ordinary person on the street , the grassroots , the ordinary band member in those communities . 
( division 361 ) 
i believe also that transparency would require - and this is the focus of other provisions in Bill C - 214 , which I tabled in this House - the government to agree to table treaties in the House so parliamentarians might be aware of their content . 
we had to properly determine the safeguards included in this bill in order to ensure the preservation of society in general and at the same time of the reputations of those who have committed serious offences and have been pardoned . 
my specific reason for asking him to produce the list of visible minority deputy ministers and ADMs is that we will then see that the numbers are so few that it will be embarrassing for him to look at it .

Mr. John Solomon 
international Women ' s Day is an occasion to reflect on the progress made to advance women ' s equality and an opportunity to assess the challenges facing women in contemporary society . 
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) : 
another point I would like to make is that this bill went directly to committee before second reading , with the intention , and perhaps this was the motivation , of keeping it out of the public spotlight despite the claim by the minister that the process was designed to accommodate meaningful amendments . 
i have asked for this for a number of weeks now as we have had this debate . 
these programs were designed to complement each other .

hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) : 
honourable senators , obviously , it is not in the interest of this government to encourage another referendum . 
however , in a few court decisions now , our courts in Canada have overridden all of that jurisprudence which stems back to 1215 and the Magna Carta . 
they would say that they would go to the courts . 
it must be pointed out that the Nisga ' a had repeatedly tried to come to an agreement with the Gitskan and the Gitanyow on how to share this territory . 
emerging technologies also present challenges to our efforts to ensure public safety and security . 
this was a recommendation by an expert under the financial auspices of the government .

hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the Government ) :

we left there in 1955 because the government decided that Michel , Natal and Middletown should not be there . 
this bill is very important to me and to some of my constituents , as well as to many of my colleagues . 
the rights of electors and third party participants in the democratic process continue to be trampled by provisions which adopt a paternalistic role in terms of dictating how much money can be spent and presuming to decide for electors who is a frivolous candidate and who is not . 
i know that all members will want to join me in congratulating Ford of Canada ' s Windsor ' s workforce for its exceptional generosity and sense of community .

Mr. Speaker , I do not know whether or not the report is correct , but I do know that the anglophone community in Quebec can rest assured that the Government of Canada and the Department of Canadian Heritage intends to continue to offer assistance to ensure that services are available to this community as we do for the francophone community .

Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health . 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .

it cannot be done in a flash . 
the agricultural sector in Canada is facing increasing subsidized competition , rising input costs , natural and economic disasters and an inadequate national safety net program while the government stands idle . 
we know these businesses are the engines of our economy and the future of economic growth . 
we must examine this legislation in a manner that allows the contents of the agreement to be fully reviewed in a non - confrontational manner .

it is an important resolution and I can indicate that my party will be supporting it . 
as the largest property owner and taxing authority in this country , the Canadian government set a dangerous example when it declared a freeze on property taxes to some 2,200 municipal governments with federal properties . 
we would reduce the capital gains inclusion rate to 50 % from the current 75 % .

he is committed to Canada . 
these watersheds are divided by a natural height of land and their resident species have been separate for 10,000 years .

there has been some procedural wrangling about this , that and the other thing . 
however , they have taken up every available opportunity to take over education , health care , social and family services and other government programs seeking wherever they could to strengthen their families and communities . 
the two proposals on the table now do not provide the discipline supplied by competition , the discipline for competitive air fares , air flights and schedules . 
as the courts have suggested , these rights are best negotiated , not litigated and that is precisely what we have done . 
citations 702 , 703 and 704 state that schedules are treated in the same manner as clauses ; in other words in terms of acceptability and form . 
he is in constant touch with the aboriginal leaders , the commercial fishery , government officials and Atlantic premiers . 
i questioned the treasury board minister at the time in committee . 
it is about how it stays in power . 
the government has given a clear indication that there was no such request from anybody . 
( division 550 ) 
we could probably do that . 
they will act as a clear guide to judges and police in dealing with young offenders . 
what the Reform Party , Ralph Klein and Mike Harris are talking about is retreating , going back to the old way of doing things before we had medicare when if we had the money we could get the care we needed and , if not , tough luck . 
then there were those who said that these young people had to be put behind bars if we wanted them to be allowed back into society , but that there was no certainty they would be rehabilitated in jail . 
this is such an obvious way to help not just farmers but everyone that I cannot understand why it does not move to do it immediately . 
one of things brought to my attention while sitting on the committee was that if one looks at how electronic commerce has developed and begun to flourish , a lot of this has been done with relatively no government intervention until now .

what we see is a state of denial by DND with respect to even giving these veterans the benefit of the doubt that their illnesses may have in fact been caused by something that happened while they were overseas . 
as our NDP colleague pointed out , the protection of personal information in the private sector , what with the technological progress being made , must be regulated if we are to protect our fellow citizens from coast to coast .

at my age , I cannot take that too often . 
financial transfers to reserves are new , and we are experiencing problems now because we are undergoing a transition phase , which is quite normal , and not because of poor management .

it is about the men , women , families and children of Cape Breton . 
it is unfortunate that the Liberal government refuses to listen to this great economist and will not do like the Bloc Quebecois and seriously consider a North American monetary union . 
we therefore think it essential that the government retain the proposal of its task force to the effect that the EDC should be subject to the Access to Information Act .

the fact is that the Prime Minister is unhappy with the National Post and its coverage of his government ' s political misdeeds . 
on the Order : 
just a point of clarification , Mr. Speaker . 
it is my intention today to address this question at the appropriate time and to propose that the matter be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders . 
absolutely we have to come to some resolution on these issues . 
we cannot legislate behaviour and ethics .

it is also important for us to recall that it was a distinguished Canadian who had a direct hand in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was proclaimed on December 10 , 1948 , by the General Assembly . 
rather than addressing the problems of our natives , our governments pretended that the problems did not exist and they hoped they would go away . 
the options are so well defined that it is now possible to think that the Nisga ' a will be able to take stock of their own resources and proceed to tax the wealth that will be generated . 
we forget it at the peril of the unity of our nation .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
we could complete the elimination of the 3 % general surtax that began in the 1988 budget . 
members 
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to present . 
Thursday , December 9 , 1999 
i am very delighted to note that many of the issues have been addressed . 
Mr. Speaker , what is very important is that shareholders of Air Canada and Canadian International be allowed to make a choice about the companies ' future . 
i think it is important that we look at quorum again .

the Hon. the Speaker : 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this group of amendments . 
it would now be expanded to include both same sex and opposite sex couples . 
they have never been told that they could not attend . 
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) : 
if it made a deal it should stick to it . 
the fact is that it is no one ' s business and there should be a tighter grip on very private and very personal medical information . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Paul Szabo : 
Mr. Jean Dub é : 
intergovernmental Affairs 
the Prime Minister says that he wants a clear majority , but our idea of a majority is the same as it was in the last two referendums and the Charlottetown accord , 50 % plus one . 
" 20.1 ( 1 ) On the expiration of three years after the coming into force of this Act , the provisions contained herein shall be referred to such committee of the Senate as may be designated or established for that purpose . 
he was referring to other people who resort to violence on the east coast . 
an hon. member :

these questions are front and centre and remain unanswered after hearing the Prime Minister ' s response to the so - called national children ' s agenda .

Mr. Claude Drouin : 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
- respect the equal rights of peoples and their right to self - determination , acting at all times in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations . 
the ENVIRONMENT 
as our children grow they must be well educated in good schools and institutions that will provide them with skills that will prepare them for work and future challenges , that will prepare them to be successful in a global economy . 
members 
human Resources Development 
if the minister is truly committed to assisting disabled people to become fully functional citizens , he must broaden his rules around the disability tax credits and the medical and the infirm dependent tax credits so that they will provide real refundable benefits for all disabled Canadians . 
that is an amazing fact . 
* * * 
if it wants to spend the money from its supporters who donate to these campaigns then it should be able to . 
if the federal government has buildings , or receives services in a municipality , then it should quite simply - particularly with the huge surpluses it has - at least pay for the services it receives , just like John Q . Public does . 
the bill was introduced here on October 27 , 1999 at first reading , that is , only a few working days ago . 
he presided over the task force and over the interim governing council . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
( c ) The festival was to promote Canadian rock music and products , CDs and videos , as part of the program marketing Canadian cultural products abroad . 
another said " It makes me feel that I should not fight because it hurts my child . 
this partisan document once again follows along the main thrusts of the September 1997 throne speech . 
however , it is not necessarily inconsistent that other possibilities might exist . 
if the Prime Minister or the Minister of Agriculture had given some emergency aid to the farmers of Saskatchewan , that 3.2 per cent of the population , it would have shown them that they have some merit . 
in November 1998 , these towers - Purdy ' s Wharf - made history when they became the first building complex in Canada to be its own Internet service provider . 
it is my hope that the government will then adopt those measures . 
government ORDERS 
is the minister responsible or not ? 
it appears the government has tried to keep it at arm ' s length and I applaud that . 
let us educate our young people so they have meaningful jobs and the kinds of income that will sustain our tax system and support the programs we are talking about in the House such as the best health care system in the world . 
canada would face criticism , not only from our citizens but from people around the world , if we were to continue cutting down thousand year old trees in this new millennium . 
Mr. Speaker , I think that it is worthwhile , considering how complicated the process has been - the hon. members who spoke one after the other earlier did not go into the historical aspects - to mention the dates , which are extremely important . 
it is my understanding that when it comes to Parliament as an institution , no one can speak or vote for another senator . 
no damn wonder it is so frustrating in this place . 
i know it will never happen with that member , not in 100 years . 
that is not all . 
whenever my constituents were given the opportunity to vote for sovereignty , they did so in very interesting numbers . 
to achieve this the Minister of Transport appointed Arthur Kroeger , a former deputy minister of transport , to involve western stakeholders in developing those operational details . 
we have arrived at the point where national and regional boundaries are almost meaningless . 
is there unanimous consent ? 
the next question is on Motion No. 248 . 
when Senator Oliver proposed his motion , which he did so with unanimous consent , I rose and asked him if it was an instruction to the committee . 
by creating Canada ' s first national park , Sir John A . Macdonald began a legacy that successive governments have continued to build upon . 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
honourable senators , I am speaking largely about Western Canada . 
canada needs a very well educated population to compete in the future . 
he had to leave this year because he had a certain retirement expectation . 
with the short growing season in Atlantic Canada , seasonal work issues are more important than they are in other regions .

they do not read Zane Grey or obscure novels from the 19 th century . 
some hon. members : 
honourable senators , I should like to pay tribute today to all Canadians , those living and those who have left this earth , for their service to our great nation through the profession of arms . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
up to this time , all Canadian prime ministers have consistently refused to agree to any such negotiation . 
this is a very important issue . 
" the excessive burden of provincial taxes , federal excise taxes and the GST are driving the price of reindeer fuel out of sight '' , said R . N . Reindeer , chief of Claus ' transportation division . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
it is , however , a practical and fair agreement that takes into account the broad spectrum of interests and sets out detailed provisions to allow people to live together in the best way that they can . 
i believe there should be a penalty for someone who does not vote . 
however , we have to develop a system for getting along in the country that is not for this year , not for this leadership , not for this government , and not for the current leadership of the Nisga ' a people . 
i was quite surprised and shocked to hear the Reform Party make reference to Vladimir Lenin in this House of Commons . 
it does seem to me that is different than normal procedure . 
motions Nos. 408 , 409 , 410 , 411 , 412 , 413 , 414 , 415 and 416 
what do members of the Liberal government do ? 
why has she been called in to justify what is going on in the Prime Minister ' s office ? 
why are we investing the lowest percentage of fuel taxes collected in our highway system of any industrialized country ? 
lastly , I want to say that the Bloc Quebecois is currently considering a major proposal in which its members are also urged to re - iterate their commitment to recognizing the existing rights of the aboriginal people , to confirming these rights and to ensuring that negotiations are carried out with the native people of Quebec in order to recognize their right to self - government . 
Mr. Speaker , gasoline and diesel prices are at record levels and home heating oil has doubled . 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
we know what to make of minister Facal ' s statement . 
on the face of it , it strikes me as not a particularly good idea . 
national Defence 
as we have seen in other investigations like Bre - X or Air India , when they are cut short the public is left to wonder what is the true outcome and what is really at work . 
members 
Mr. John Finlay 
it is important , in this institution in particular , that as full disclosure as possible is made . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy 
we should have the final say , not the courts . 
Mr. Speaker , for the information of the hon. member , the Prime Minister has shown leadership . 
i am always surprised when this issue is raised , because the feeling is that , in the scientific community , ethics are at the forefront . 
miss Deborah Grey 
we want a new start for aboriginal Canadians in this country . 
you will be our first speaker when we return to debate after question period . 
they do not have resources and they are not getting access to the resources on reserve . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
it is the cornerstone of our quality of life - providing Canada with the means to continue building a more equitable society , a healthier population , and stronger communities . 
right now Bill C - 2 is before a committee in clause by clause consideration . 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
members of the NDP said the same thing . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
Mr. Speaker , earlier this morning , the federal government announced almost three quarters of a billion dollars in assistance to alleviate homelessness and help prevent homelessness . 
that is only one of the problems . 
some hon. members : 
although the intent is very much the right one and the direction is very much one which I think most Canadians would embrace , the legislation is thick , cumbersome and wordy . 
national DEFENCE 
we will continue to do further work and go beyond . 
as a francophone member from northern Ontario , I am proud of my language and I am proud of my beautiful country , and that is why I support this bill . 
orders OF THE DAY 
it does not give a damn about minority rights . 
motions IN AMENDMENT 
because we wanted to be the international Boy Scouts of the marketplace , with all due respect to the Boy Scouts because they sometimes get maligned by being associated with the government . 
senator Stratton : 
let us look at its actions because that is really the most telling sign . 
a referendum that worked was the Charlottetown accord . 
the minister mentioned , in particular , that acts of mass murder are morally repugnant . 
they are getting pretty angry with the government ' s mismanagement of their money , yet the Prime Minister does not seem to think there is anything wrong . 
honourable senators , in that there does not seem to be agreement on this matter , perhaps debate could be adjourned and the matter proceeded with tomorrow . 
the provinces are digging and scratching . 
members 
Mr. Juneau claimed he was actually saving taxpayers ' money because it would be cheaper for him to attend the fundraiser to talk to Liberal cabinet ministers than to fly to Ottawa . 
Mr. Speaker , the outrage of the people of Canada against this inactive Liberal government continues . 
i say unequivocally that is not the position of the New Democratic Party . 
that the Special Committee be composed of five Senators and that three members constitute a quorum ; 
it is not clear who sets these goals or who monitors them to make sure they are being met . 
the minister said that Libman had ruled that it was reasonable to have spending limits on third parties . 
calls upon the Nuclear Weapons States to make an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the speedy and total elimination of their nuclear arsenals and to engage without delay in an accelerated process of negotiations , thus achieving nuclear disarmament , to which they are committed under Article VI of the NPT . 
Mr. Speaker , I guess Canadians should believe the government because we know the facts and the hon. member obviously does not . 
it is said that for every dollar invested there will be a saving of $ 6 , there will be fewer youth dropping out of school , a reduction in teenage pregnancies and a reduction in youth crime . 
many people could learn a lot from Karl . 
i declare Motion No. 465 lost . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris : 
if the House gives its consent , I intend to move concurrence in the second report later this day . 
there are two different concepts here . 
paired 
we will keep a close eye on that . 
first , why would the House of Commons be so hesitant to intervene in a dispute between a member and a senator ? 
the total benefit for status Indians on reserves is estimated to be $ 19,903 per person . 
it is important for there to be measures in the bill to improve the federation . 
their communique also states : 
( response to question raised by Hon. Douglas Roche on February 22 , 2000 ) 
all the parties in the national assembly and a great many community groups in Quebec and in Canada are begging the federal government to withdraw Bill C - 20 . This shows that there is a strong consensus in Quebec . 
since 1760 , and even before , Quebecers have always been challenged to excel , if I can put it that way . 
my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate is - and I do not envy him having to put his finger in this particular crumbling dike - in light of the serious nature of this issue , will the government provide full , unexpurgated , uninterrupted and complete audit rights to the Auditor General , and will it hand over all the files pertaining to the granting of all the funds to an independent external examiner ? 
oral Question Period 
member FOR DARTMOUTH 
this is our responsibility as senators . 
if we look at River Road in Delta , it is a local road . 
some new provisions of the enactment deal with election campaigns , including spending limits on third party election advertising , a blackout on election polls and election advertising on polling day and the day before polling day , a requirement that the methodology of a poll be published with the poll ' s result , the right of electors to post reasonable signage during a campaign , and an enforceable right of candidates to campaign in multiple residential buildings during reasonable hours . 
introduction and first reading 
Mr. Speaker , we should stop making this debate personal . 
appropriate Level of Reserve in Employment Insurance Fund 
the occupants of the other place would no longer work in relative obscurity such as those members in this place who are in parties which do not get a lot of time to speak . 
i asked Officials from the Treasury Board why the costs had escalated by 50 per cent and if they could give me a breakdown . 
for reference year 1996 - 97 , the most complete in our statistics , we see that crown corporations contributed to the Liberal Party campaign fund . 
exceptionally , we had an amendment that has constituted the first group , and we have seen very quickly where the government stands . 
in reviewing the situation at hand and in looking at the obligation of the government to designate Ottawa as officially bilingual , would that designation include the full concept of equality under official status , including the equality of rights and privileges , not just language ? 
i am sad to say that the same situation exists in Manitoba . 
we want to make sure that we start as soon as possible . 
is this the meaning they give to the word " consultation '' ? 
the tourism industry in my riding certainly has lessons that it can learn from the way the people of Halifax are applying that call centre and applying that money . 
i would like to say that I am sure the government is in a pre - election mode . 
however , I do have a motion , and I will give it to the page to take to the Table . 
let us just agree that he can speak to it on Tuesday , rather than invoke a blanket precedent - which would be tempting for others to invoke . 
even though we are in favour of the bill , it is still a bit regrettable that these agreements were not approved by parliament . 
we have to be careful about that . 
i first met Ron in 1976 , when we were both active in supporting the same candidate for the leadership of our party . 
he roared , but when his principles were betrayed , what did he do ? 
i declare Motion No. 469 lost . 
the next question is on Motion No. 404 . 
he tries to suggest that because we do not have a number of seats in western Canada that we are not going to stand up for the interests of western farmers . 
i am not sure whether it was out of conviction , but apparently this person gave $ 10,000 to the Liberal Party and in addition provided three limousines with drivers . 
i know how this government chooses and I know how Canadians choose . 
they have volunteered to improve our schools and our community . 
i do not think that will get us very far now , but I do think that tens of thousands of people need to get out there and let MPs know that this is where we want to go . 
the new identities initiative is one of the areas where we are at the cutting edge . 
has the government seen fit to bother to try to help with programs at post - secondary institutions for students to get jobs in this regard , or will we be importing jobs applicants from other countries ? 
earmarking tax revenues for a specific item would limit the government ' s capacity to redirect federal expenditures according to its changing priorities . 
Sierra Leone is ranked last of 174 nations under the human development index . 
Mr. Speaker , over 1,000 transitional jobs fund grants were handed out by this government . 
however , we have been informed that the real processing time is more like 17 months under the current act .

Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
the House met at 10 a.m. 
over the years I have learned from the Nisga ' a people . 
at that time , actions were being taken by the Untied Nations Human Rights Commission and there was ongoing bilateral condemnation . 
the motion of the hon. member for Edmonton East proposes national standards for residential care facilities agreed upon by the provinces . 
economic DEVELOPMENT 
on the basis of that stated objective , it is a bill worth supporting . 
on the issue of relevance , the member is reading from an affidavit taken from a civil process somewhere in the country . 
our task force agreed with the testimony of witnesses that the threshold above which income tax becomes payable , that is , $ 7,131 , is much too low , as Canadians should not be expected to pay taxes on an amount that is not even sufficient to cover their basic expenses for food , clothing and shelter . 
this new act is also contaminated with the same old Liberal patronage system of appointing hacks as Elections Canada returning officers . 
some hon. members : 
this publication also says that the report is either put forward by the chair or another designated member of the committee . 
Cape Breton Island has had make work projects for a very long time . 
we know they will keep up their high standard of work for us in the future . 
there are three possible sites that I have identified : 
it has made a decision . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to speak on the issue of the farm income crisis in Canada . 
one farmer said " I have been a producer representative on the old senior grain transportation committee that existed '' . 
agreed . 
madam Clarkson succeeds one of our former colleagues who brought special personal characteristics to a demanding and not always understood role . 
at that stage the Nisga ' a would be required to allocate resources , time and energy to administering the process . 
i would appreciate an answer to that question . 
they support , or demand , an early adoption of new legislation on the issue of liability for the maritime carriage of passengers . 
the most immediate threat is to lighthouses in Cranberry ; however , Whitehead and Eddie Point could soon be targeted upon the completion of the Cranberry transformation . 
his perceptive good humour would constantly direct me toward what did and did not matter in this house . 
blood SAMPLES ACT 
the situation will be extremely confusing for Quebecers . 
this is why your ruling is so important . 
my grandfather was born in 1866 and by 1880 , at the age of 14 , he was working in a coal mine in Scotland . 
in my view , the prospects for future development at this airport appear to be excellent . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the framework ensured the government bill , preserved Canadian ownership and control of our airlines , fostered domestic competition , ensured there is no price gouging , preserved services to small communities and protected the rights and concerns for employees . 
members 
if an agreement affects provincial jurisdiction , the provinces should be brought in early to make sure they understand the impact it will have on the provinces . 
we know that those projects have made a difference in the lives of Canadians who otherwise would not have opportunities to work . 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
the auditor general himself was interested in the way the army was spending the money allocated to it . 
we received answers that had nothing to do with the truth . 
members 
any pursuit of the employer is costly . 
for the government , of which most of its members are from Ontario or other provinces , to argue that the Nisga ' a final agreement is being accepted by the people of B.C. , is just a ridiculous statement if we look at the democratic process that we live under . 
i think people can vote as they see fit . 
hon. Paul Martin 
i have always argued that to deduct something from a person ' s paycheque for a specific reason and then use it for something entirely different is fraud . 
senator Gauthier would like to speak to this inquiry on Tuesday . 
i know that I speak for all of us when I say that the Senate and Canada loses an excellent representative today . 
agreed . 
under this bill , water means surface or groundwater , but does not include water packaged as a beverage . 
i would ask the hon. member to withdraw the words hiding the truth . 
canada should be a model , a unifier , or a moderator . 
we want this to be a simple piece of legislation , and it must be well drafted . 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased at the entry point of the new millennium to talk about the millennium scholarships , to see that the Bloc has finally agreed that they are a very important piece of our partnership together , and to say that the foundation recently announced , in advance of its original timeframe , 70,000 grants to needy students across the country . 
that when the Senate adjourns today , it do stand adjourned until tomorrow , Wednesday , February 23 , 2000 , at 1:30 p.m. ; 
that leaves the question of whether the draft Alberta bill on health care legislation , for example , is substantially similar . 
i believe at least part of the rationale is that the people of the country will have the opportunity to express their views through their elected representatives . 
honourable senators , I regret that the time for Question Period has expired . 
they were not asking simply that the mines be kept open . 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
the Nisga ' a agreement fails to provide Nisga ' a people with private property rights , fails to provide Nisga ' a women with the same rights and protections enjoyed by all other Canadian women and puts in peril the charter rights of each and every Nisga ' a individual . 
Mr. Serge Cardin 
it really does not matter whether they ban hunting for a whole day or for a half day until noon , our hunters can take to the woods but at the 11 th hour on that day the intent is to lay down the weapons and pause for two minutes to remember those Canadians who did so much for us . 
over the last 30 years Canadians have paid an increasing proportion of their earnings in taxes to heavy - handed , uncaring , uncompassionate Liberal and Tory governments . 
may I remind the NCC of its mandate statement , which is listed on the Government of Canada Info Source Web site and states : 
i have talked to him about this on several occasions . 
the member for Tobique - Mactaquac , at the Chair ' s invitation , because the member was called away , had the floor to express his comments . 
why doesn ' t it include increases in CPP contributions ? 
quite frequently the people enjoying better levels of economic success will ultimately see opportunities too and demand greater democratic reforms . 
here are some interesting statistics . 
i believe all laws that we pass in the House must be cost effective at achieving this goal . 
in this era of economic liberalism , performance and the quality of goods and services are the main factors that will make or break a company , and that has to remain . 
members 
they recognize that it is an unelected house and Canadians do not need people looking over their shoulders who are not elected representatives .

it is an article published in Le Devoir on February 21 , 2000 , entitled " The National Movement of Quebecers Launches a Campaign to Promote Sovereignty '' , and I quote :

division No. 456 
the third myth is that the Nisga ' a final agreement permanently entrenches the same essential elements as the reserve system in a modern treaty . 
i would personally like to thank Mr. Gleave for all the years of his public service . 
in August , when it was clear that no progress had been made , I complained to the access commissioner , who shares my concern . 
let us be fair . 
these are very tangible commitments for Canadians living in rural remote communities . 
bell ' s " electrical speech machine " paved the way for today ' s information superhighway . 
i would suggest that a vote be subtracted - 
members 
let us hope that next year we will have good news , that the tide will change to reverse this illness , that less and less people will be infected and that more and more lives will be saved . 
i find it quite astonishing that some members , especially those of the Reform Party , would claim that the government is trying to hide something here when it was the minister herself who made the internal audit known to the public . 
i suggest they have more wisdom on the Nisga ' a treaty . 
in its presentation , the Conseil du patronat says that for information collected , used and transmitted in the province , the personal information protection act that will apply in the private sector will be the Quebec act , while the federal legislation will apply to information transmitted outside the province . 
Peter was supposed to sit in the front seat and " just stab '' . 
Mr. Speaker , let me go back to the myths of the Reform Party . 
how can the minister call this a serious management response ?

Mr. Paul Cr ê te 
madam Speaker , if I used the word dishonest , I meant misleading , that the Bloc Quebecois has been misleading the people in Quebec with regard to what the ramifications of a clear question would be .

it should not be based on the group that screams the loudest . 
this issue has been before the courts on several occasions in Alberta and in both cases the court ruled that imposing spending limits on third parties is unconstitutional . 
the problem is that those individuals over there have no argument to articulate other than " You are bashing , you are bashing , you are bashing '' .

i would like to point out to the House that some commercial fishermen are natives .

when I hear the millionaires who populate the front bench of the government talk about concern for the poor , whom they put on the tax rolls and from whom they extract billions of dollars , it is a little bit disingenuous . 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) : 
harmonization of policies that affect trade can be of great benefit to Canada as it promotes fairer competition and contributes to increased competitiveness in industry and greater access to foreign markets . 
one fine morning the federal government said " I am withdrawing from this area '' . 
this was true in eastern Europe , it is still true in the Balkan countries . 
the cost of complying with American federal regulations has risen to 47 % of the federal budget , up from 40 % in 1988 . 
i share the objective that is pursued with this initiative . 
agreed . 
these are both offences . 
if the hon. member is aware of a complaint having been filed by someone he knows , he should tell us about it . 
members 
it jeopardizes a vital prerogative in Quebec . 
that is not too different from the recent M. v H . case we saw ruled on in the supreme court . 
there are numerous other court decisions , various decisions by provincial courts and appeal courts . 
i also happen to know that the NDP member from New Westminster is not with the member on this bill , even though he can usually be relied upon to promote preserving forests in British Columbia , the taking of land from the working forest and putting it into the preservation of the forest . 
Mr. Speaker , I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to table a newspaper article published in Le Soleil under the title " Claude Ryan Condemns St é phane Dion ' s Bill '' .

this government , which boasts about having the monopoly on clarity , is asking a very ambiguous question that lends itself to very different interpretations by voters .

this is urgently required and is something that the Senate is particularly suited to doing , as opposed to the House of Commons where other events often get in the way of studies of this nature .

madam Speaker , it is with great sadness that I rise again today . 
we are now at the moment of truth . 
when it comes to the government , its action is no different than the B.C. government that rammed through the Nisga ' a treaty in the provincial legislature against huge opposition . 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member should know , if she has read the standing committee report in this regard , that the standing committee wanted the federal government to make sure there was more co - operation between the WTO and the International Labour Organization and , in terms of the environment , to make sure that environmental standards were high on our list .

i am surprised and disappointed at the Bloc Quebecois ' support for this agreement . 
it is very clear and this refutes one of the arguments of our adversaries who say " What is included in the agreement is not necessarily included in the act '' . 
this is not a mistranslation . 
that is what is meant in the preamble of the final agreement when it says that the final agreement is intended to provide certainty with respect to the ownership and use of lands and resources . 
those who attack these notions do so not because they have any justification - in fact , it is quite the opposite .

that schools , political institutions and , especially , many politicians decline to uphold Canada ' s great constitutional heritage is a great tragedy . 
we have pleaded with the agriculture minister to make some very small changes that would allow more American beef to come into Canada . 
moreover , nothing in the treaty limits the application of the charter . 
this is also democracy that gags the work of the House and the work of the committee considering Bill C - 20 . Let me explain . 
the last review took five years .

why then did the minister not at least inform the member that , due to changes that occurred in the process , the grant would no longer go to the riding of Rosemont but to the riding of Saint - Maurice instead ?

they want to see their country put aside alienation and differences and build on the strengths of diversity , the strengths the official opposition has outlined in the new Canada Act on how we can make our federation work better . 
it is not yet clear how this will be accomplished , but any peace initiatives need to be rolled into the IGAD process .

hon. Landon Pearson :

however , the precedent is certainly there . 
Mr. Speaker , I am very happy to speak to my hon. friend from the Bloc Quebecois . 
does he not lie awake at nights regretting that he did not more vigorously pursue equality when he had the chance in the 1960 s , or wonder whether it was too late to find a solution ? 
unfortunately it never happened . 
imagine working poor in our military . 
we will not have to get out of our cars and freeze a bit in the process . 
having the information before me as a member of parliament , I really do welcome this debate today . 
it is why members of the Progressive Conservative Party are supporting it . 
honourable senators , the Speech from the Throne is the mechanism by which the government of the day outlines its vision for the country and sets the tone in which this institution shall operate . 
agreed . 
Mr. Speaker , I heard an hon. member across the way say that this should be good . 
i thought Your Honour would at least move to the other side of the House so that we could put our point of view forward . 
equality seems to be a word that is truly absent from its vocabulary .

on my return to the guardhouse I asked the sergeant what had happened .

Russian waste will only be imported if Canada pays for it . 
first he said he was still looking for support for this proposal . 
i believe the Speech from the Throne carries a strong message of hope for Cape Breton and for the other regions across this great country that are very similar . 
this government is so arrogant that it is trying to impose policy by stating that the provinces , and Quebec is in the forefront with its exemplary policies on daycare and early childhood , will be able to provide additional services in their own areas of jurisdiction . 
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , Lib . ) :

last year the supreme court ruled that the federal government must negotiate with a province that votes in favour of a clear constitutional question . 
protectionism in the international trade of agriculture is on the rise . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
it cost Quebecers a lot of money to establish that program . 
it was invoked halfway through the debate in that province . 
i do not know what the commotion is about because we are here to ask questions and hopefully to get answers from the other side . 
he now has the nerve to stand in the House and talk about poverty and children when he voted against money going to low income families and to children .

Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague , the Reform Party finance critic , for his excellent presentation in debate today . 
he is forging ahead with his swords into ploughshares plutonium test burn program despite the fact that Canadians do not want to be involved . 
however , he went on to state that the matter was very serious and if any special circumstances were brought to the attention of the House and the Chair to the effect that members were in some way intimidated in their work or prevented from discharging their duties freely and without hindrance , there would be no hesitation in recognizing the matter as a breach of privilege . 
the Treasury Board officials said they would get back to me , and the Honourable Leader of the Government in the Senate said he would get back to me .

if a youth sentence , for example , would not be adequate to hold a young person accountable , the court may impose an adult sentence . 
with all due respect please listen to the hon. member . 
revised Report of Committee 
i would venture to say that it is probably a laudable goal for all businesses to have better tax provisions so that business can thrive whether it is a shipbuilding company or any other company in the country . 
that is how municipalities raise their funds , through taxation , through property taxes . 
it is okay to take a stand on a bill and I acknowledge we did it on the Nisga ' a bill . 
when Laurier came to power , Canada was in financial trouble . 
the number of people who are in on this debate is interesting . 
i hope it is not another example of the federal government ' s bad habit of steamrolling the provinces . 
we have been working with federal departments to analyse the implications of the judgment .

the Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise in the House today to honour one of my constituents , Reverend Garth Legge of Richmond Hill , on his being named a member of the Order of Canada . 
he gave a tremendous speech and allowed us to contemplate Canada today in the context of our past . 
Mr. Speaker , I think you would find unanimous consent to withdraw any existing motions for emergency debates on the fishery issue and to adopt the following : 
further to the point of order raised by the hon. member for Verch è res - Les Patriotes concerning Motion No. 1 , I have again examined the scope of Motion No. 1 and I agree with the member that this motion should be voted on separately . 
we have the case of prairie pasta producers who are trying to pull themselves up by their bootstraps by further processing their durum wheat into pasta flour and products . 
the criminal justice system must be able to respond to various contributing factors to youth crime . 
agreed . 
it was probably $ 200,000 or $ 300,000 no doubt for that little trip . 
as I said at the outset , the bill we are discussing today is straightforward and simple . 
can he answer me that ? 
they start by looking at the list of candidates of all the parties to see which has managed to persuade the most women to wade into battle . 
neither does the treaty prevent anyone from accessing their interests on Nisga ' a lands . 
our electoral system has certainly made its mark throughout the world . 
they wore it in the victory at Vimy and in the heroic hours at Normandy , in the tragedies at Somme and Dieppe , in the liberation of Sicily , and in the valiant push to clear Europe of the horrors of Nazism .

the market revenue program now extended for two more years needs to be confirmed for a longer period .

he says , " I have $ 90 billion to spend and I can hardly wait .

Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the hon. member two very specific questions . 
that is only the tip of the iceberg .

hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
agreed . 
am I incorrect , Mr. Speaker ? 
will the minister not agree that , under the circumstances , the testimony of her predecessor , the current Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , and of the Prime Minister are vital to shed light on this misappropriation of funds in order to serve the election objectives of the Liberal Party of Canada ? 
we recognize that these issues are tremendously complex . 
i think what the honourable senator has been doing is very ambitious . 
i am sorry about monopolizing the time in the context of my former bill C - 235 . 
it is common knowledge that the government has torn $ 21 billion out of the Canadian health care system in the last six years . 
this conclusion is compatible with s . 32 of the Charter , which limits application to " the Parliament and government of Canada " and the " legislature and government of each province " .

let us not mention names , although I will do so at some future time . 
this was most clearly and most tragically apparent in the nature of his opposition to the Meech Lake accord , the failure of which led to the formation of the Bloc Quebecois and the resurgence of separatism in Quebec .

motion No. 26 agreed to 
the choice of the farmer is the important issue . 
reform will be supporting the bill . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board . 
in light of the bill that we just passed , is the Leader of the Government personally committed to the principles of pollution prevention , polluter pays and , most important , the phasing out of the manufacture , generation and use of such toxic chemicals so that in the future we need not be faced with this question again ? 
i talked to people face to face and tried to see the problems from their point of view . 
it has worked quite well . 
Mr. Speaker , this year for the first time in 12 years there was an increase in the defence budget aimed specifically at improving the remuneration and quality of life of our Canadian forces . 
we need to recognize how important our children really are to all of us and to Canada .

the Speaker : 
now the little scandal in Shawinigan has mushroomed into a billion dollar boondoggle at human resources . 
honourable senators , I take it that some portions of the honourable senator ' s question were not entirely serious in their content . 
Mr. Speaker , I see I have only one minute left for my remarks . 
the current situation is not normal , and we will not be content with 2 % , 3 % , 4 % or 5 % increases in certain small programs in the next budget . 
eventually the government will know , but it will not tell anybody and maybe it will finally get around to telling us '' . 
No. 
it is also needed to permit this new economic engine to thrive on national and global levels . 
people who run a household know about setting priorities . 
will the money return to the public coffers ? 
the minister is right in saying that , but he forgets that the charter of rights and freedoms , besides defining those rights and freedoms , also contains section 25 :

the bottom line is that there is no creative awareness within the federal government in particular , and there must be a new way of looking at the issues of farming in the West . 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today in the House to speak in support of the efforts of my colleague from Winnipeg North Centre in terms of ensuring that Bill C - 13 , which aims to establish a new framework for health research , becomes an effective piece of legislation that will be able to redress some of the problems in linking health research to practice in Canada . 
unfortunately the member is not from the province of British Columbia which really makes his argument moot . 
for instance , I am told that in Latvia there is a Canadian woman . 
that is the vision of this government : to have billions of dollars in its pocket and to let a situation such as currently exists in the west worsen . 
we are dealing here with what can only be described as the modern day version of the industrial revolution .

honourable senators , if the Speaker has a sensitivity to dealing with this issue as an abstract matter now , perhaps we could deal with it today when we come to Senator Oliver ' s motion .

everyone would agree that this is a great deal of money , particularly the operating subsidies for Devco .

the third is the provision of a process to deal with individual cases of whistle - blowing , a process that operates on the public interest basis and removes from the shoulders of the individual public servant the strain and stress of dealing with wrongdoing and having it dealt with by one of the three commissioners of the Public Service Commission of Canada .

Mr. Alex Shepherd 
there have been changes over the years based on various court decisions and so on , but this is the first opportunity we have had to modernize the Canada Elections Act .

Mr. Speaker , I think perhaps we should ask them to include the record number of time allocations and closures that the Liberals have brought in as another abuse to democracy , and that is why we are here tonight . 
even as it protects the rights of citizens to have their citizenship and their province within Canada against the misguided wish of their provincial government , the bill respects at the same time their rights to secede from the rest of the country should they clearly express that will by a clear majority vote on a clear question .

honourable senators , I have a question for the honourable senator . 
that the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs be authorized to examine and report on the consequences for Canada of the emerging European Monetary Union and on other related trade and investment matters ; 
so what ? 
subclause 1 ( 4 ) states , very plainly , that this clear expression of will cannot result from either a question that merely focuses on a mandate to negotiate without asking for a direct expression whether the province should cease to be a part of Canada or a question that mixes in other possibilities in addition to secession from Canada .

a number of these people , I am told , showed up a couple of weeks ago at St. FX University for a special seminar and tribute to their former professor . 
the partners in the international space station signed the original agreement in January 1998 . This agreement provides a legal framework for the operation of the space station , including provisions for each inhabitant of the station to be subject to the laws of their own nation , a very important sovereignty issue for all the participants . 
let us get to work . 
the hon. member asks why there is a surplus . 
i believe this is an excellent initiative as well , but it was also outlined in the Reform minority report . 
however , evolution does not mean we should get rid of all of our traditions . 
i will conclude on a political note . 
viability of West Coast Salmon Fishery - Need for Emergency Help - Hunger Strike by Dan Edwards 
it denies free votes to its own members in the House and it denies votes to other Canadians through referendums like in the Nisga ' a case . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
Mr. Rick Casson 
members 
many past speakers have spoken to very important aspects of the bill but have not really explained what the bill is about . 
we want to play the role of brothers and sisters equally across the country . 
report of National Finance Committee on Main Estimates Adopted 
not one line in the throne speech has shown any understanding of the very harsh realities facing students who are trying to get through school . 
many levels of law enforcement and government are involved in protecting public safety . 
she kept it quiet . 
is every member of the government proud of the national child tax credit ? 
hon. Andy Mitchell 
remember , we have done this before with the Yukon and the Sechelt . 
i will mention one case from the early nineties . 
i thank the hon. member for his offer but there is no doubt . 
i would have to examine the record to see exactly what I said . 
however , the situation deteriorated a great deal when the report on the Export Development Corporation was tabled . 
second Reading -- Debate Continued 
a subsequent order has been adopted and published in the Canada Gazette . 
an hon. member : 
can the minister explain to us how she can reconcile the orders she gave to her staff to make departmental information public with the fact that MPs are reduced to relying on the Access to Information Act to get hold of more credible information ? 
why would they not ? 
our producers , merchants and traders have long understood and thrived on the reality of globalization . 
will he tell us what his plans are for eliminating the chaos in the trucking industry ? 
will the solicitor general be following up on this report and , if so , is closing RCMP detachments the government ' s new strategy for combating organized crime ? 
is that not scary ? 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
second Reading 
No. 
there is a pairing book but it still is private . 
if we want to take our case to public tribunals , we can . 
we have heard the views of a number of separatists on the right of new Canadians to take part in an election . 
possible Closing by Ontario Government 
we all know that Quebec has received the short end of the stick when it comes to funding . 
never shall I cease to criticize the waste and abuse of the Senate . 
that strengthens the parent - child bond , improves parenting , makes sure kids have their basic needs met and avoids a lot of the trauma that is so devastating to children when their brains are developing . 
nobody every meant the Nisga ' a treaty to become - 
the employment insurance program has many good parts to it . 
it has been an embarrassment to have to use this time on Bill C - 4 to talk about the Nisga ' a treaty . 
this is a situation where people are very much the victims of federal government neglect and of the failure of leadership that permeates every aspect of our society . 
concurrence IN VOTE 35 A - SOLICITOR GENERAL 
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur 
i know I do not . 
statistics Canada gives metropolitan status to cities with a population density of 100,000 people living in an urban core . 
i think this is something that we should look at again and consider . 
motion No. 306 negatived 
this past year commercial fishing was completely closed on the Fraser River for the first time in history . 
in other words , the more surplus the more lolly the ministers can dole out to friends in their ridings . 
in the not so distant past , our ancestors welcomed the newcomers and helped them . 
agreed . 
the timing is good , because later on I will explain how Quebec has a number strengths in research . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
the Liberal government is committed to addressing the plight of the homeless . 
i trust that the government will be responsive to these crying needs , that it will make investment choices in areas such as poverty that will be extremely important for researchers in the health field , and this must start at the grassroots level . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
the hon. member for Mississauga West has the floor . 
discussion should not be about federal and provincial powers and who does what , but about what governments can do together to help people in need , lest we forget that the children of today will be the leaders and taxpayers of tomorrow . 
honourable senators , I , too , wish to thank His Honour for agreeing that this was an appropriate subject for emergency debate and thank my friend Senator Gustafson for bringing it forward . 
senator Hays : 
i am most grateful to Senator Lynch - Staunton for raising this matter , which I think is an important one . 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton , NDP ) : 
( division 351 ) 
the board will have to determine whether the truckers are employees , dependent contractors or independent contractors and , in the first two instances , if their employer is governed by federal legislation . 
members 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
the ENVIRONMENT 
new Democrats are tough on crime , contrary to popular opinion . 
miss Deborah Grey 
they sit an average of 65 days a year , for about three hours a day , and half or at least a third of the senators are absent half of the time . 
the fact is that all of them will have to eventually be translated into accommodations in terms of how native and non - native fishermen will approach the fishery . 
hon. Claudette Bradshaw ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
he never bothers to visit the farms . 
does the hon. member for Saskatoon - Humboldt have the consent of the House to put forth his reasons for the application for an emergency debate ? 
we can do that in this place . 
another area of research could be arthritis . 
it does not say that if this has not been done , you cannot take another practice . 
let me now turn to some specific elements in the policy framework . 
Mr. Speaker , before answering the question , I too would like to congratulate the hon. member and I encourage him to speak French more often in the new year to show everyone that Canada is really a bilingual country , as the Liberals like to put it . 
however , they will receive $ 1.7 billion over three years when they need , at a minimum , $ 2 billion , and probably closer to $ 3 billion per year , simply to bring them up to where they were five or six years ago . 
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) : 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
introduction and first reading 
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
an insurance agent who behaved like the Prime Minister and the Minister of Human Resources Development would be taken to court and at risk of being sent to jail . 
procedure and House Affairs 
we have the Peterborough Cancer Society in my riding . 
and it is doing it very awkwardly . 
the world has seen the future and it is Canada . 
the House met at 10 a.m. 
they also began to consider a process for dealing with the broader impact of the Marshall decision . 
as it is now almost 11 o ' clock , we will proceed to Statements by Members . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 363 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
honourable senators , I will provide this chamber with a quote that was uttered by an honourable gentleman in relation to another agreement before the House of Commons . 
division No. 617 
tabling OF TREATIES ACT 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
senator Boudreau : 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
canada has ambitions ; it wants to look good abroad , but can we still afford our ambitious objectives ? 
it is our hope that the year 2000 will bring for the people of Lebanon law and order , prosperity , happiness , full independence and territorial integrity and a comprehensive , complete and lasting peace . 
i was focusing at the beginning on the honourable senator ' s observation that she found nothing in the bill in terms of its principle that she could support . 
this whole thing could have been avoided if we had moved on using part of the charter that allows us to use the notwithstanding clause . 
the reforms range from the creation of a military ombudsman , to the revamping of the military justice system and to the implementation of quality of life initiatives . 
if the member wants to look for where there is corruption or where there is mismanagement then perhaps he should go into the business community , into some of the financial institutions , to see what is going on there . 
liberal GOVERNMENT 
here are the results . 
wanting to better manage the taxpayers money , which is understandable , this government proposes new accounting procedures for managing public funds . 
division No. 426 
therefore , because of the prevailing sentiment in the nation at the time , many colleagues across the floor surrendered their once strong support for plan A and flocked to the masses as they adopted plan B , all in the name of electoral success . 
is there unanimous consent of the House ? 
what happened ? 
Mr. Richard M. Harris 
bill C - 4 legally formalizes Canada ' s partnership in the space station . 
i think everyone will agree that the socialists have fallen all over the world . 
the member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , one of the few in the Reform Party whom I respect , said : " I believe that it is a worthy , viable and visionary undertaking which warrants your consideration and ultimately your approval of the applications '' . 
canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group 
not only was there the death kiss of Clyde Wells and the actions of the present Prime Minister , but Canada too rejected this minimal agreement . 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
in my riding of Kitchener Centre , organizations such as the Mennonite Central Committee have worked with CIDA and have been able to assist individuals who are in need and living in devastated areas such as Kosovo . 
the government has gone into areas where it ought not to be . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
if we are going to have a debate in the House , these members have to start from the premise of reading the treaty itself line for line . 
there are also constitutional reasons for having a referendum on this issue because the agreement establishes a new order of aboriginal government with jurisdiction over many areas of activity which were formerly the exclusive prerogative of the federal and provincial governments . 
that party ' s members need to learn the lesson of sitting around the table with separatists when trying to run this country . 
do they not agree - 
honourable senators , only when our actions match our words will we become a trading nation on the ground as well as in the air . 
farmers pay a lot of tax on fuel , as well as fertilizer . 
everyone in my hometown of Sault Ste. Marie was riveted to their television sets to watch Team Canada and two of its favourite sons , Phil and Tony Esposito , who were instrumental in Team Canada ' s victory . 
does he not realize that the average age of farmers in Saskatchewan is 59 ? 
now , having given the background to this bill , I would like to address the matter of the amendments proposed in Bill S - 10 . 
premier Klein is not the problem . 
we are delighted with that . 
NMD RAISES LARGE ISSUES 
Mr. Speaker , the enthusiasm of the hon. member who just spoke is well directed . 
let us do the math . 
interpretation ACT 
has any bagman of the party approached any of these firms either before or after the award of these grants ? 
i should like to remind you of the comments made by the Honourable Royce Frith on February 21 , 1990 , and recorded in the Hansard of that day , when he called the attention of the Senate to the issue of violence against women in Canadian society . 
we want to increase trade , not reduce it . 
we are very confident that it will be . 
some hon. members : 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz 
today there are further motions which improve the bill even more . 
honourable senators , I , too , wish to ensure that my motion and this question of privilege not be lost . 
some hon. members : 
standing Order 76 ( 3 ) requires that notice of such recommendation be given no later than the sitting day before the beginning of report stage consideration of a bill . 
that is wrong . 
that was not good enough . 
is there unanimous consent to extend the time for questions and comments to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
we have had an opportunity to be at the helm a few times and we will no doubt have an opportunity , as a political party , to be at the helm in the near future . 
the Marshall decision states : 
we met one young woman , for example , who , having received three months training , is now in charge of the spiritual direction of 1,000 people . 
the next question is on the main motion . 
Mr. John Bryden 
members 
the treaties are long , complicated documents reflecting years of negotiation and much compromise on both sides . 
adjournment PROCEEDINGS 
there is some indication that those discussions are already taking place . 
under the Nisga ' a constitution , only Nisga ' a citizens can enjoy full voting rights and full economic entitlement to the fruits of any settlement . 
they feel that the supreme court did not have enough wisdom in terms of the outcome of the decision it rendered . 
first among them is the fact that a one size fits all model could never work . 
instead of trying to develop our regions , instead of trying to create more jobs , this government has taken away the only program that helped these people . 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill 
did members ever see the hon. member for Vaudreuil - Soulanges stand up for Quebecers in the House and disagree with the government ? 
members 
Mr. David Pratt 
i would say the honourable senator ' s statements in this regard are a red herring . 
there are a number of other issues in this bill that are worth mentioning . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
some hon. members : 
the report of the New Brunswick auditor general , Daryl Wilson , yesterday leaves little doubt that the former Liberal government painted itself into a corner with the Moncton to Fredericton and Moncton to Saint John toll highway deal by failing to explore several alternative options . 
bill C - 9 - SPEAKER ' S RULING 
Mr. Proulx certainly does not engender pride among the citizens of Hull - Aylmer , any more than he engenders pride among the members of the Liberal Party of Canada , even though Liberal supporters are trying to explain to the people of Hull - Aylmer that Mr. Proulx ' s behaviour is not so serious and that he can justify it . 
( a ) to persons of Canadian birth who sat as members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom , including Ontario - born Edward Blake , Liberal Minister of Justice of Canada 1875 - 1877 , also leader of the Liberal Party of Canada 1880 - 1887 , and New Brunswick - born The Right Honourable Bonar Law , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1922 - 1923 , and Ontario - born Sir Bryant Irvine , Deputy Speaker of House of Commons of the United Kingdom 1976 - 1982 ; 
Mr. Speaker , as we all know , squeegee kids are carving for themselves an economic niche at the margin of society but still within it . 
Mr. Speaker , the third petition calls upon parliament to recognize the traditional definition of marriage as the union of a single man and a single woman . 
i am convinced that the government will not respond to what has just been said on possible abuse and failure to abide by the rules governing protection of personal information for reasons of national security or other reasons . 
the north is very important for this country and is seldom mentioned . 
Mr. Speaker , many farmers across the country are going broke or are having a difficult time making ends meet . 
as small business operators they can make full use of tax advantages not available to employees . 
there is nothing partisan about this particular effort . 
naturally , the increasing broad application of alternate service delivery has been unsettling to hundreds of maintenance technicians who have proven that they can provide maintenance at a cheaper cost than any civilian contractor . 
these are positive steps , but there is still much left to be done . 
somehow it is un - Canadian to give them back some of their money . 
i think this procedure will work . 
hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
this is something that the government traditionally holds close to its chest , refuses to talk about , spends taxpayers ' money on but will not release to the public . 
they need the authority to walk into a place and take children out who are being sexually abused . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy 
amendment to the amendment 
that is how I know that these maintenance people are excellent , however , they are not miracle workers . 
we have seen thousands of protesters on the Hill with respect to the homeless . 
would the hon. member agree to give the municipalities more time to look at this piece of legislation in order for them to decide what they agree with or do not agree with ? 
the hon. member for L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re . 
agriculture 
Mr. Speaker , the Supreme Court of Canada , in refusing to rehear the Marshall case , has reminded us of the importance of actually reading court decisions before jumping to attack them . 
Mr. Speaker , within the Liberal government , there is an apostle of things nuclear who would like to see more nuclear power plants and waste . 
the Americans are funding their farmers . 
members 
i wonder as well if Ontario and Quebec have been consulted . 
i am speaking of people in northern Russia , northern Finland , northern Norway , northern Sweden and Greenland . 
however , honourable senators , read paragraph 101 . 
international Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
i can only implore the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Prime Minister to hearken back to that document which was created by Mr. Trudeau , read it again and listen to what he said . 
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER 
we in the Reform Party have undertaken a very creative initiative in politics in Canada by representing in the House of Commons the wishes of the people who elected us . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
however it is there . 
i think the member would concede that the government has covered the bases in terms of putting the framework in place so that all members in this place can work together to deal with homelessness . 
Mr. Derek Lee 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne ( Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert , BQ ) : 
in the last federal election , 67 % of the people voted , partly because they say , " What ' s the use ? 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings 
agreed . 
in this case , 459 files were pulled out and reviewed . 
the campaign is intended to alert religious groups , members of ethnic groups and certain vegetarians with dietary restrictions . 
members 
Mr. Beno î t Serr é 
national DEFENCE 
which private sector ? 
it has to stand the test of time . 
in Oka a few years ago we all saw how quickly such tactics could get out of hand . 
honourable senators , 8 to 9 per cent of Canadian trade is with the European Union . 
these evidentiary weaknesses become quite evident in the Marshall case . 
i would encourage the hon. member to return to his home province to be there too with the federal government . 
the response of $ 320 million in new programs is a very significant one as concerns the fishery on the East Coast . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
members 
of course , 70 % of nothing is nothing . 
i stated , mistakenly , that Mr. Chr é tien had been Minister of Justice in the Trudeau government prior to the 1979 election . 
in so doing , he made use of the Terry and Harrer decisions , which clearly stated the proposition that the Charter did not apply outside Canada . 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond - Guiral ( Laval Centre , BQ ) : 
finally , volume I of the report by the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing , better known as the Lortie Commission , in addressing the need for independence of election officers reaches the same conclusion on page 483 : 
Mr. Scott Brison 
Mr. Speaker , as everybody knows , all the assets of the Minister of Finance were put in trust the day he became the Minister of Finance . 
hon. Don Boudria 
liberal GOVERNMENT 
we have no jurisdiction . 
the other major blunder to which I referred earlier is the fight against poverty . 
Mr. Jim Abbott 
madam Speaker , it is always disappointing to hear members opposite say that the Quebec separatist leaders will never let it die . 
audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
there is another issue . 
honourable senators , there is a request by Senator Spivak to table letters . 
it is in the name of this same humanism that we must intensify our fight against organized crime . 
when a certain number of cases are unacceptable , a red light goes off . 
as well , imposing life imprisonment for impaired driving might result in some ridiculous situations . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy 
accordingly the question is deemed to have been put , a division deemed demanded and deferred until the conclusion of Government Orders later this day . 
i am in the process of reading the motion presented to the House . 
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Ted White 
Mr. Speaker , I did not intend to rise but I cannot let a sin of omission prosper . 
a Nisga ' a government established in accordance with these provisions could invoke section 1 of the charter like any other government in Canada . 
rightfully , the priority of the department of the government is not in this region . 
a few government members spoke for form ' s sake . 
( 2 ) The committee designated or established for the purpose of subsection ( 1 ) shall , as soon as practicable , undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions and operation of this Act and , shall within three years after the review is undertaken , submit a report to the House of Commons . " 
nays 
what is important is how that money is spent and to what end . 
that still leaves the Nova Scotia Power Corporation short - something in the range of 1 million tonnes . 
he then said they would have to tender out this route as a matter of course to show the public that I did not own it permanently . 
members 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
when asked to identify what government priorities should improve their productivity , 44 % of respondents identified easing burdensome government regulations . 
we feel that the bill is extremely paternalistic . 
hon. members may rest assured that the federal government will continue to work closely with provincial governments , and we are working closely with provincial governments to ensure that sufficient disaster assistance is provided in the most timely manner possible . 
that is hard to believe . 
when it comes to court decisions like the one granting a specious fishery right on the east coast based nowhere in the law , the government accepts the decision and says that it is the court speaking and we must respect it . 
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary has put a motion before the House . 
i was offended that , in the course of the steps toward self - government , there was a rush to take away the natural resources and that , afterwards , the negotiations mysteriously began to move . 
article 17 ( 2 ) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights states : " No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property '' . 
now we have two railroads that we have paid for in both ways and someone else owns them and they are expanding everywhere . 
some hon. members : 
honourable senators , if the honourable senator ' s suggestion were taken up , I wonder if it would be one of the first non - partisan appointments made in this country by any Prime Minister of any political persuasion .

some hon. members : 
the Liberal government claims to be a responsible government . 
second reading and concurrence in Senate amendments 
human RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
is this heading in the direction that the government intends it to ? 
Mr. Derek Lee 
the present federal government is proposing to limit us to one vision : the status quo or this unhealthy obsession with separation , as the Prime Minister of Canada sees it . 
we want a full debate in the House to elicit the views of hon. members on both sides of the House so we can develop an airline policy that will deal with the difficult matters we have to overcome in order to have a very strong and viable airline system in the 21 st century . 
we had a substantial debate on the death penalty when we dealt with the Extradition Act . 
my children have much more mature discussions . 
this is the largest decline in unemployment under the leadership of any Canadian government in over 50 years . 
the Internet site will also lead the world to Canadian businesses . 
that is a key point that we would like to see addressed in Bill C - 10 . 
i want to broaden the context of it . 
i believe that the point made by the government House leader is correct . 
i also remember the sorry outcome of this social union framework . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am going to take a different tack . 
Mrs. Caldwell has gathered a further 5,200 signatures calling on parliament to enact legislation providing for tougher penalties to be meted out against those who commit sexual assault against children .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
on whose side is the Leader of the Government , honourable senators ? 
the government refused that proposal on the basis that the aboriginal peoples of Quebec are not a party to the amending formula . 
people in my riding of Matap é dia - Matane think it does not make any sense to have cuts in health care and accumulate a $ 95 billion surplus . 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
( division 617 ) 
that is the kind of approach the member takes to constituent work . 
why is it spending a fortune in legal fees trying to make sure that this case is never heard in court ? 
Mr. Werner Schmidt 
that at 3:30 p.m. tomorrow , if the business of the Senate has not been completed , the Speaker shall interrupt the proceedings to adjourn the Senate ;

information technology , industry , academics and music are very important parts of the Cape Breton economy that have been developing . 
i do not doubt that everyone feels the same way about what the pressures of a student might be while he or she is a page in the House , but I understand that the House has already provided shifts for the pages so that in fact they will not be here all evening as the rest of us might be . 
it relates to a question I posed on November 4 regarding the Sea King helicopters . 
hon. Lloyd Axworthy 
what about Bill C - 110 , respecting constitutional amendments , which was given Royal Assent at the end of 1995 ? 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
they are concerned about the environmental effects of the Canadian Coast Guard authorizing the sale of gasoline through a gas station floating in the narrows of the Shuswap Lake . 
this gives an idea of the scope of the projects . 
that statement is a direct word for word extract from the blue book of the Reform Party . 
we are faced with a very crucial issue in and of itself , the issue of what the Prime Minister is up to . 
speech from the Throne 
many of the shipbuilding industry ' s detractors claim that the industry is in decline and that demand has dried up . 
we look very busy and we hand these cards out . 
Mr. Speaker , the government is completely confused on the pay equity issue .

sections 9 , 10 and 13 come into force on March 08 , 2004 and the remaining provisions of this Act come into " 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
at that same table sat the two aunts of our current finance minister . 
the first great deficiency in principle and vision that we see in the Speech from the Throne is the lack of principle and substantive commitment to the great principles of fiscal responsibility , in particular tax relief that is the key to both sound government and a prosperous economy for the 21 st century . 
motion No. 177 
we need to spend more time pursuing some of the social and economic policies that can help reduce the poverty and dependence that can lead to it . 
Mr. John Solomon : 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
they are no match for the effervescence and vibrancy that we , supporters of this government , feel . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the Speech from the Throne does not even acknowledge the existence of these problems , let alone offer solutions that are based on some kind of vision of the future for those sectors or some kind of fundamental principles . 
members 
others who are not his friends get paid later or they do not get paid interest or whatever '' . 
i would think that the hon. member opposite who likes to represent his constituents would applaud it for having that as part of the flexibility of this program .

Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
that there being no Statute of the Provincial Legislature confirming or ratifying the British North America Act , and it never having been consented to nor authorized by the people , nor the consent of the Province in any other manner testified , the preamble of the Act , reciting that this Province has expressed a desire to be Confederated with Canada and New - Brunswick is untrue , and when Your Majesty was led to believe that this province had expressed such a desire , a fraud and imposition was practised on Your Majesty . 
the speech made by the member for Wentworth - Burlington is probably one of the finest speeches I have heard in the House in a long time .

we stand today before a new century confident in the future of our country . 
it also has a long lasting impact on the reputation of Canada and people look to other sources .

it would allow members opposite to be enlightened on Bill C - 20 . This is an article entitled " Ryan Condemns the Federal Initiative " that was published in the daily newspaper Le Devoir of February 22 , 2000 . 
indeed , Bill C - 20 is totally confusing in that respect , the very opposite of the principle of clarity it proclaims .

i cannot agree with the honourable senator that increased interest rates would be good for the country . 
some initiatives the government has taken , and I am thinking specifically with respect to the Nisga ' a treaty , lay the foundation for prosperity for our aboriginal peoples . 
Mr. Speaker , I would urge the member , who is still making allegations , to listen to his leader , Lucien Bouchard , who had the following to say in Los Angeles two days ago " I do not wish to comment on all that . 
i do not think senators should reflect on members of the other House in that way .

Mr. Jay Hill : 
the point raised by the hon. member is right but not exactly . 
i was part of the committee which heard from many witnesses . 
Mr. Speaker , I am not too sure I can rise to the occasion as my good friend just did , but I too would like to raise some problems and to advise the government of some difficulties I see with the bill in some areas where I think it is somewhat negligent .

honourable senators , any government can promote the political option that it was put in power to promote , such as in the case of the Parti Qu é b é cois . 
senator Ghitter ' s contributions to this chamber have been enormous . 
inquiry - Debate Continued 
( the House divided on Motion No. 124 , which was negatived on the following division : )

in the official opposition ' s dissenting report on Canada ' s position in the upcoming WTO negotiations it urged the government to make agriculture the number one priority and noted that tariff and subsidy reductions are crucial to the future success of our farms .

Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien : 
we launched a lot of committees across the country to get input from people , to hear what they had to say . 
it is critical that we do it . 
in particular , we set up several programs specifically for the homeless . 
" ( 2.1 ) 
that is critically important . 
it always has been and it always will be . 
( division 747 ) 
w provide a single window to Canada - wide information about labour markets , skills requirements and training opportunities - on the Internet , over the telephone or in person in communities across the country . 
motion No. 100 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
i declare Motion No. 58 lost . 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) : 
i can assure the House that nothing could be further from the truth . 
we like having the opportunity to talk to him , but when there is an emergency , he should be there where he is most needed . 
our constitutional amendment process is designed to ensure that changes to our fundamental law will occur only after careful federal - provincial steps are followed , steps that involve the various legislatures and Parliament . 
there was supposed to be an announcement last fall but it was put off by the airline crisis , and perhaps it is understandable that it was delayed for a few months . 
sadly , they do not have those opportunities today . 
it is long overdue . 
question PERIOD 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
this would create a victim ' s mentality that would generate feelings of inferiority , acrimony and indifference . 
what confidence should Canadians and the provinces have that the Prime Minister will do their bidding ? 
i do not believe it is the best solution , but I fear that unless Canada Post has a better relationship with its rural route mail couriers and gets into a contracting procedure that is fair and honest , it will simply invite more of this kind of thing . 
applied clinical research is a very important area , since it plays a fundamental role in the discovery of new drugs . 
that the Committee be granted leave to sit when the Senate has been adjourned pursuant to subsection 95 ( 2 ) of the Senate Rules ; and 
national HORSE OF CANADA ACT 
the rapid rise of the electronic media , now soon to be overtaken by the Internet , has instigated some pseudo - critics to argue , to stoke a false clamour , that the age of literature and thus the age of poetry and prose is coming to an end . 
they either don ' t have the answers to the fundamental questions that people are asking , or they do and they don ' t want people to know what those answers are . 
even that is not automatic . 
there was no punishment for this man who killed two innocent young women , because he had already received the maximum sentence . 
Mr. Bernard Patry : 
the arms of Brunswick consist of two gold lions on a red field , and the arms of the King contained the three gold lions of England . 
it is another myth that we have been hearing for a long time . 
an hon. member : 
that the motion be amended by adding , after the words , " Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2000 " the following : 
i declare Motion No. 277 lost . 
the National Post had published unauthorized drafts of the Aboriginal Peoples Committee report . 
if I were a fisherman in northern Saskatchewan wanting to sell pickerel somewhere , I could easily find some buyer through e - commerce , but the freshwater fish industry is regulated under freshwater fish marketing rules . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
canada , as a medium power , benefits by a rules based world where might is not right . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
hon. Consiglio Di Nino : 
what are the features that are so distinctive in this treaty ? 
child PORNOGRAPHY 
you have all , I am sure , read the document I gave you in June . 
isn ' t it legitimate for the federal government to want to assess the clarity of the question ? 
what did it hope to accomplish by means of this intensity rule ?

36 th Parliament , 2 nd Session 
at the present time we at least have some access and some accountability through the minister who is obliged to answer questions , at least if he feels like it . 
i challenge anyone in the House to identify anything that the Hudson ' s Bay Company has left in our northern villages . 
oh , oh . 
the more we are what we are , the more openness there will be between us . 
some hon. members : 
but now the minister is changing his tune . 
it is good to hear today that the New Democratic Party is supporting the fact that we will be in Seattle standing up for Canadians . 
members 
the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted . 
there are too many examples that tell me it is not the case . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay 
yet , court rulings have consistently and clearly demonstrated that first nations do indeed have rights . 
today ' s debate on the motion of the hon. member is one example .

government CONTRACTS 
Mr. Claude Bachand 
Mr. Scott Brison 
they paid for what they did . 
it was not an audit . 
i ask the unanimous consent of the House to - 
but is it improving ? 
Mr. Daniel Turp 
Mr. Speaker , the government just released its response to the organ donor crisis in our country . 
i have the same difficulty that he does with the composition of the board . 
some hon. members : 
we are neither going blindly into the future nor setting anchor in the past . 
an investment that will yield such substantial economic benefits is a good investment . 
another thing we found out today is that since the Marshall decision has come out , besides the chaos and uncertainty this has created in everyone ' s lives in the maritime region , on March 8 of this year the Mi ' kmaq nation came to Ottawa to discuss the proposed Marshall decision with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the minister at that time . 
he knows that we have constantly spoken out about the cuts made to transfer payments by the government and how that has put enormous pressure on the federal system and opened the door to private sector health care . 
the hon. member for South Shore on a point of order . 
why ? 
personal INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
there is no precise rule on this point , but the Speaker ' s ruling is always reasonable , as the member for Roberval should know , and I am sure that he will agree with that . 
the Prime Minister has challenged Canadian businesses , especially small businesses , to take advantage of the opportunities for electronic commerce . 
he was dead , and the letters kept coming . 
it is certain that Reform Party members cannot have it both ways . 
women were being discriminated against . 
honourable senators , I have a supplementary question . 
his presentation was astonishing to those of us who may not have focused on just how far we have come in the last 25 years . 
we do not see anything . 
Mr. Speaker , I repeat , equal pay for work of equal value is the basic principle here . 
before we get to the next member I must make a correction to the ruling I just made with regard to Group No. 2 . I had initially ruled that Motion No. 106 could not be put because it was out of order in that it required a royal recommendation . 
again I return to the fundamental flaws in the member ' s approach to seeking greater privacy protection . 
it certainly does not generate enough income , even if it is extended . 
the hon. member says one thing which would be his understanding . 
as to the question of health care , I am aware more specifically with respect to Nova Scotia because that is my home province . 
we are referring the subject matter of the bill to committee and not the bill . 
as someone who was educated in a convent , my husband tells me that I am a compulsive rule follower . 
there will be further stonewalling by the majority representing the government in that committee . 
they are therefore petitioning parliament to summon Canada Post to give them the same level of consideration as regular and permanent employees . 
meanwhile , I will send them a copy of the letter that I sent them last Wednesday , on the 10 th anniversary of the motion on poverty . 
i will not dwell at length on the many stages we went through before undertaking this reform , because these are well known . 
i was in the member ' s community . 
it is very clear that the government ' s lack of policy and direction is part of the problem . 
i wonder why , instead of striving for harmony and seeking some kind of agreement , the Liberal government constantly does its best to pour oil on the fire . 
what would happen if that happened in the space program or at the international space station ? 
the Chair has been left a little unclear as to exactly what is intended . 
it is also interesting to note that a recent study of young people in Canada found that they aspire to have strong families . 
i agree with those who say that there are problems with Canada ' s air transportation system . 
fostering good government and strong accountability in First Nations communities will increase investor confidence , support economic partnerships , and improve living conditions . 
this same Prime Minister was willing to change this agreement , this legislation , to allow his friend Schwartz from Toronto to take control of Air Canada and Canadian . 
clause 6 provides that the registrar shall endeavour to ensure that the provinces participate in a number of co - ordinating measures . 
i do not know if the dramatic situations that farmers are talking about will materialize . 
it is patently unfair for this information to be at the beck and call of government members and not to be disclosed to all members of the House . 
in addition to studying illness and disease , our health research system needs to support the study of the social and environmental determinants of health . 
he has often spoken to me about some of the difficulties in sorting out these questions . 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
since obviously the Reform Party including the Reform health critic have decided to forgo this important opportunity , I would like leave of the House to ask a few questions of the health minister .

Mr. Ken Epp : 
why would someone like Marc Lalonde , a former Liberal minister who must surely be respected by the Liberals , want the 10 % limit maintained ? 
i was so impressed and I took so many photos that I ran out of film . 
twice - in November 1997 and November 1998 - the Minister of Transport has mentioned that an agreement could be renewed to complete the construction work on this road , if funds were available .

that Bill C - 9 , in Clause 27 , be amended by replacing lines 7 and 8 on page 10 with the following : 
they may also work out an arrangement for the sharing of services , whether it is snow removal or whatever the particulars are of the local area . 
an amendment to be introduced while we are at second reading is a reasoned amendment . 
we as legislators have a moral obligation , yet some in the government would have us abdicate that moral responsibility to the courts . 
i hope that the rural mail couriers will understand that when we were in power we were the ones who put in section 13 ( 5 ) to protect them and Canada Post employees at the same time .

Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
i see this in the case of Quebec and in the case of Canada as well . 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister has received a letter from Dr. Pierre Gauthier , the president of the F é d é ration des m é decins sp é cialistes du Quebec , calling on the government to abandon its plan to increase funding for home care . 
we could give away our goods . 
let us be clear . 
everyone was saying that because the bottom had dropped out of grain and hog prices that we needed to do something to address it . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
the bill proposes to include some structures and improvements which used to be excluded from payment . 
they accept to remain silent about a bill that is so important that it impacts on everyone in Quebec and in Canada . 
and yet , many people throughout the world right now , including people in Montreal , seem inclined to oppose the talks and to call for a moratorium . 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
since today is the final allotted day for the supply period ending December 10 , 1999 , the House will go through the usual procedures to consider and dispose of the supply bill . 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
let us not continually say that they are in trouble and that we have this little welfare program for them . 
the bill and the co - operation there has been within the House of Commons among members of parliament are examples of some of the good legislation that we can work together on , that we can co - operate on . 
we are not the same society that we were in 1882 when the criminal code was created and the age of consent was established as 14 . 
i am running out of time but one more point needs to be made . 
Mr. Roy Cullen : 
it will also be subjected to extensive hearings by a standing committee of the Senate . 
we know that this debt is typically repaid over a short and brutal lifetime of illicit activity , sexual exploitation and forced labour . 
they want a piece of it because they love their children too . 
it is the responsibility of government and community , family , friends and teachers to open doors and encourage young people to seize their dreams . 
we should allow police officers to use discretion in resolving minor incidents without laying charges . 
they have said we are in a disastrous situation and we are on a perilous course of action . 
the hon. member is talking about the signature of cards . 
this has to be a major step forward for perseverance . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 371 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
i commend the last speaker on his remarks regarding the agreement , but I also ask because of his ability to look at legislation and his interest in these kinds of things if we could have unanimous consent for a five minute question period of this member .

i first met Ron in the fall of 1975 in Calgary , and there ensued a period of some months when we worked together in the first leadership campaign of the Right Honourable Brian Mulroney . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard 
already , more than a year has passed since Dr. Diane Riley put forth her report in November of 1998 on drugs and drug policy in Canada , prepared for Senator Nolin . 
i do not want to diminish that , but it is important that when we make these changes we get them right . 
we have to respect the obligations of this country vis - a - vis the first nations of Canada . 
this is one of the rare sites of the departments of foreign affairs of developed countries where the country ' s treaties may be accessed , with a few rare exceptions . 
it is currently an agency within a department and under the bill it will become a crown corporation . 
i have to say to you , Mr. Speaker , that I am deeply disturbed by the fact that this afternoon it has been impossible for those of us at this end of the House to follow the speech of my colleague and his predecessors , even though we have an earphone system . 
Mr Speaker , I ask that all other Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers be allowed to stand . 
what is nonsense about this treaty is the number of people I have talked to who are adamantly against it yet they have not read it . 
hon. Lorne Nystrom 
hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
the contractor would then be faced with a difficult decision : undercut his or her own price by several thousand dollars or else lose the contract .

we know that the prices of commodities in 1996 - 97 were some of the highest prices that we have had in the industry for a number of decades . 
motion No. 14 negatived 
why were they not informed that the agreement was being considered ? 
there is a huge difference between the ability and the right . 
is the government even aware that the proportion of visible minority members entering the female dominated administrative support category is at 40 % ? 
Mr. Speaker , I want to take the opportunity to wish you and all members of the House the best for the holiday season , a healthy and safe holiday season . 
the Speaker : 
the Minister of Transport replied : 
agreed . 
rather , these are ways of bringing about a vision , our vision , the vision of all Canadians for a strong , united , and prosperous Canada with a quality of life unequalled anywhere else in the world , a Canada whose successes know no limitations . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay 
Mr. Jacques Saada : 
a very reasonable manner , Madam Speaker . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
it is an article published in the December 2 issue of La Presse entitled " Quebec alone must see to the clarity of the question '' . 
the third party spending limits would effectively silence citizens who wish to express contrary views . 
returning officers should be appointed on merit ; they should not be political appointments . 
it should be reformed or replaced so that it actually delivers payments to farmers in combination with provincial contributions in the order of the $ 25 to $ 50 per acre promised in the press releases and the public statements of the minister . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai 
before doing away with 16 years of practice , adjustments and precedent to go in a direction that breaks with almost a century of tradition , parliamentarians must ask whether this is a worthwhile effort . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
this is a very shady approach on which Canadians will judge the government harshly in the next general election . 
i declare Motion No. 244 lost . 
i would like to know the basis of your ruling , with which I will fully comply , but which seems ill - founded at this point . 
a treaty does not change the law of the land in our country . 
the Bloc Quebecois has proposed amendments which , if adopted , would make the bill acceptable . 
government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
he told me that there has been a doubling of clubhouses of Hell ' s Angels in and around the city of Montreal in the past six months . 
the ECONOMY 
these agreements allow first nations to live in Canada , not as a conquered peoples , but as true partners in Confederation . 
there is the negotiation , for example , of treaties in the context of the United Nations , which often acts as a forum for conferences , where debates are held on the treaties and lead to their passage . 
the information I am now receiving from Health Canada - and we have to be very careful on this because there is no way of saying for sure that this is going to happen - indicates that probably within the next couple of weeks this drug will be approved . 
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) : 
the next question is on Motion No. 363 . 
this money is helping local communities maintain or improve services and support economic development . 
this issue requires further study by the Minister of Justice , as recommended by the Westray inquiry report . 
i call on the MP to have the conscience and fortitude to admit his words , withdraw his comments and set an example by apologizing to people of colour , to his colleagues in the House , and to all Canadians .

it would seem only logical to have people ' s organ compatibility levels easily accessible in a national database so that matches could be made in seconds once the organs become available .

it is not its role to finance infrastructure or to own it . 
the deceptive thing about these cards is that every one is a winner . 
Mr. Chuck Cadman 
what does it mean ? 
by reducing benefits and further penalizing those who leave their jobs voluntarily , the government shows very little concern for the victims of the economic crisis .

on Wednesday , subject to discussions between the parties , we shall likely begin consideration of Bill C - 8 , the marine conservation areas bill . 
it was in comparison . 
this could be targeted to the youth ' s particular circumstances , such as attending school , finding employment or obeying a curfew . 
moreover , in 1983 , the Canadian government passed legislation respecting the protection of personal information that applies to over one hundred government agencies under its jurisdiction . 
i would like to tell the House that there is a company , C . F . Dickson Forest Products , which gave $ 1,000 to the PC House leader during the campaign , but did not give a cent to the Liberal Party . 
the purpose of this bill is to ensure that if during the process of a search and seizure property is damaged or lost , the people who own the property will be compensated for that loss . 
while this does not exonerate them from the crimes they have committed , it gives us an understanding and an insight into why these children have committed offences .

students have asked that the loans be changed to scholarships . 
canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group 
i would categorize it as Liberal rhetoric versus the Liberal record . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
in its ruling , the supreme court mentions clarity 25 times , and politicians , particularly federal politicians , have a responsibility to ensure that clarity exists and that Quebecers know exactly what to expect . 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the wisdom of my colleague , the member for Winnipeg - Transcona , who has been involved in these issues for some 20 years . 
it will be good to have it spelled out more clearly in the Canada Elections Act that candidates actually have a right to go into apartment buildings during reasonable hours to canvas . 
it is unfair to characterize my opinion as one where the government could not proceed . 
the Quebec Court of Appeal was very clear that the prosecution had lost , in part because the prosecution had done such a rotten job . 
why has the Minister of Finance failed his first test of leadership in not defending the interests of 7.5 million Canadians ? 
this past weekend , I looked through some of the debate and committee testimony in the other place . 
agreed . 
the fact is that for rural poverty and urban poverty the demographics are strikingly similar . 
they said his actions were inappropriate . 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , while we were engaged in various activities to mark the tenth anniversary of the House of Commons resolution to end poverty , the Liberal members on the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs were moving that the defence budget be substantially increased .

let us move the bill on to committee . 
members 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
you are correct . 
we were looking at maybe $ 3.5 to $ 4 billion , maybe half the capitalized value of the Crow , to be put into what we called a trade distortion adjustment program which would compensate farmers for damage done due to unfair trade in other countries around the world . 
my initial interpretation of the section in Bill C - 2 dealing with mergers requires simply that two political parties wishing to merge obtain a signature of two leaders in respective parties . 
it is falling on deaf ears . 
when we see what is happening in other countries , we need major changes in Canada . 
old AGE SECURITY 
i understand why the hon. member on the government side would not want to see the bill come into play because it certainly places an additional onus upon us . 
beyond that , we are now paying copious quantities of quid to the previous ambassador to the WTO in his new role as consultant . 
that Bill C - 8 be amended by deleting the Title . 
hon. George S . Baker 
Canadians do not buy that the trade minister can make it easier for wealthy investors to profiteer from health care and education without sacrificing our schools and hospitals . 
i would like to thank all members of the committee for their hard work on this bill . 
when will he recognize that labour is required to create market value ? 
as well , the Nisga ' a people will have a greater opportunity in the area of resource development , but this is only a small part of what the final agreement entails . 
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) : 
of course this is going to be a non - partisan effort . 
i am not sure the American constitution is an example that the Canadian people would be willing to follow .

Ms. Raymonde Folco 
however , it is regrettable that atrocities continue and that the most vulnerable in our society continue to be disproportionately in the category of those who lose their lives , dignity , safety and security . 
this initiative of the member for Laurentides is a good opportunity to begin to correct this situation . 
i also remember an occasion when Senator Simard began a speech but , due to his speech difficulties at the time , Senator Kinsella assisted Senator Simard by completing the speech for him . 
we could increase the basic spousal allowance amount . 
what are people going to think 14 years from now ? It is serious stuff . 
would the Minister for International Cooperation tell Canadians , is this another classic example of flagrant mismanagement of taxpayer money ? 
honourable senators , community consensus is a wonderful thing . 
senator Kinsella will recall that I noted that I am not the member of this chamber with the greatest legal expertise . 
i am very happy to speak about the institutes of health research , because this is an issue very dear to me , that I have been following now for a long time .

it is a complete mystery to me . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :

somewhere in the cabinet process , someone came along with a pair of scissors and a pot of paste and decided to paste the two bills together and make them one . 
it would be a mistake to think that , with its bill , the federal government is the only one to give priority to an area that is crucial to Quebec ' s economic and technological development . 
justice Jean - Guy Boilard confirmed that he had satisfactory evidence of totally unacceptable interference . 
the media will be there but at tremendous expense . 
the government knows very well that there is no point in getting distressed at the effects politics can have on the polls . 
procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
in the last few years , there has been more awareness as a result of the debates here in the Senate and as a result of our work on the joint committee . 
Mr. Speaker , that is why it was so important for us to lower contributions each year since we came to office . 
the hon. member for Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre has asked for the unanimous consent of the House to move an amendment . 
i choose that word so that I can be parliamentary . 
that is why we created 13 integrated proceeds of crime units in 1997 . 
this is a very exciting time in the history of our country . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the related issues are much more complex and touch virtually every aspect of our society . 
as long as the government can ensure systematic and effective scrutiny of the police control processes and ensure that Bill C - 7 is used only for checking criminal records and those involved in sexual offences , Bill C - 7 is very much acceptable and necessary as a violation , a minor infringement , I would suggest , of the charter of rights and freedoms . 
the next question is on Motion No. 96 .

yet in Washington this past year the standing committee on agriculture was told time and time again that supply management and state trading enterprises were number one and two on the American agenda . 
this is an urgent situation . 
it is a good thing that we can count on these members to unconditionally defend Quebec , its national assembly and the freedom of its people and that we are not in the same situation as in 1982 when we had 74 Liberal members from Quebec in this House who supported the unilateral patriation of the constitution initiated by Mr. Trudeau . 
it states here that he is wise enough to put on the record that tax reform is an important issue .

the ability of the agriculture and food industry to overcome the current challenge rests on the strength and stability of its foundation at home .

Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
on the threshold of the year 2000 , we prefer to mollify ideological dinosaurs nostalgic for a less noble era , when a Canada of nine provinces plus one was determinedly anglicizing its society and all its citizens , French - speaking , aboriginal , and newcomers . 
the Government will also continue to ensure that Canadian Forces have the capacity to support Canada ' s role in building a more secure world and will further develop the capacity of Canadians to help ensure peace and security in foreign land . 
however , tax cuts were not to be at the expense of important social programs such as health , education and poverty .

the member for Nanaimo - Cowichan , regarding an organization called " Loaves and Fishes '' , said : " I would like to request that any and all avenues of financial resources be considered in assisting this important work to continue . 
the new bill will repeal the Medical Research Council Act and will set out the structure , mandate and operation of the institutes . 
while the Nisga ' a leadership may be an honourable one , and I do not dispute that and have never disputed that , the concentration of political power in the hands of government on Nisga ' a lands is worrying partly because the government will in fact largely be spending outside money provided by the Canadian taxpayer and because of the precedent this arrangement sets for other treaty settlements . 
it is about bolstering the Bloc and the Reform Party . 
request for Programs to Eliminate Conditions 
we have learned that the government House leader wants to act quickly and that he is pulling out all the stops to speed up the bill ' s passage through the House . 
on top of that , Cape Breton as a whole has one of the highest cancer rates in the entire country .

members 
Mr. Speaker , let us be clear here . 
these are the sorts of things that an intelligent legal study by a parliamentary committee , that is now envisaged for this new type of legal relationship , will get into . 
madam Speaker , it is a pleasure to take the opportunity to describe how the Nisga ' a final agreement deals with private property and land ownership . 
there are areas like Windsor where 10,000 trucks a day are coming across the bridge and are being dumped into downtown Windsor . 
the constitutional ramifications of the Nisga ' a treaty are extensive . 
order , please . 
we have been at this exercise now for 24 hours , at a total cost of over a million dollars to the Canadian taxpayers . 
they should have stood up . 
i think every Canadian recognizes and is proud of what our national flag symbolizes .

it being 6.15 p.m. , it is my duty , pursuant to order made earlier today , to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the report stage of the bill now before the House . 
Ms. Judy Sgro 
i listened to Senator Carstairs ' excellent speech yesterday in this chamber . 
what is that role ? 
it has completely failed to deal with the issues that are a little more difficult to deal with . 
in my March 4 th Reasons I recited the history of these earlier allegations . 
we all know that there are some in Canada who will judge the success of countries solely by how much money they can make . 
we were told that " The motion would impact on all the bills passed in the House '' . 
yet the Bloc Quebecois claims that it wants to plunge Quebec into such a situation . 
will the solicitor general honour this request and reimburse the RCMP overtime costs ? 
the government prefers to continue hounding the successful , just as social democrats would do . 
Phalen closed before anyone thought it would , and that is the problem at hand at the present time . 
committees OF THE HOUSE 
that is pretty straightforward .

even provinces such as Ontario and Saskatchewan are threatening to pull out of the federal safety net program because they recognize that the government is not truly committed to helping our Canadian farmers . 
some hon. members : 
is he saying that those agreements are in jeopardy ? 
he set the standard for this . 
early on in the history of the United States important social reforms were struck down by the courts in the name of property rights .

for all of this , it must - 
we will not go into that because First Air is a very nice airline but hon. members can figure out what we renamed it . 
will it have the integrity to keep to its promises of the last election and the election before that for national home care and pharmacare ? 
that means as long as the Prime Minister of Canada is happy . 
i believe , and I say this with all respect to my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois , the motion reflects the past . 
these are contracts where the competitive process is bypassed in favour of a particular contractor . 
madam Speaker , fashion criticism is always appreciated , particularly if it is positive . 
NAFTA removed the tariff barrier , and that is why jobs have been created in my constituency . 
we have a group of people that want to work and train but are unable to do so because of the high cost of training and the high cost of getting into the business . 
the member for Oak Ridges said : " We have to have to have confidence in the system '' . 
Ms. Angela Vautour 
i am in your hands in that regard . 
is that agreed ? 
in this case , it makes a great deal of sense to refer this particular bill to the Foreign Affairs Committee under the circumstances of the real debate that took place in this chamber . 
when he offered me his book as a present , he cautioned me that he was doing that in lieu of charging me rent for storage . 
reformers , on the other hand , would like to take us further in the other direction . 
the success of a political party is intrinsically linked to its supporters loyalty to it , not the least to its leader , no matter personal disappointment or setback . 
is there unanimous consent ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the quality of services at airports is already in jeopardy . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne : 
Mr. Speaker , this is an unfounded insinuation . 
is that what democracy is all about ?

Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :

Poulin , Senator Jean - Robert Gauthier , as well as the people of Ottawa and all Canadians to join me in turning to the courts to protect their rights and that of all those who believe in a country which holds the linguistic equality of French and English to be an important mark of civilization and freedom essential to human dignity . 
the court , therefore , has not contributed to clarity . 
this is done for public safety reasons . 
Ron , I will miss you , your counsel , your humour , your pivotal role in our caucus , our dinners and our trips .

technology is altering every aspect of our lives . 
the farmers out west know darned well that we are attempting to address the problems they are facing and that it is a crisis . 
it has left a small but vital part of our community unrepresented and without a voice .

Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 256 , an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act , 1999 ( qualifying for benefits ) . 
yet no one deals with all the environmental problems , since in terms of accountability and responsibility , no one looks after this area at Environment Canada . 
criminal sanctions and non - compensation for farmers would do little to advance the environmental cause .

national UNITY 
i think the time has come to acknowledge that young people of 16 and 17 are much more informed these days than their counterparts many years ago . 
what a government can do is create conditions for a productive and competitive agricultural sector as a whole . 
that is obviously taking examples to a ridiculous end . 
some 83 % of the programs have been transferred to local communities and an additional 7 % have been transferred to the provinces . 
... an amendment to the Constitution of Canada would be required for any province to secede from Canada which in turn would require negotiations involving at least the governments of all of the provinces and the Government of Canada . 
there is a hole between 2005 and 2008 .

indeed , the Honourable Antonio Lamer publicly expressed his views on this fact . 
it absolutely astounds me , with the encroachment of organized crime into every part of Canadian life , that the government just basically sits on its hands . 
the majority of people in my riding would be absolutely opposed to defining marriage as a same sex relationship . 
it formalizes our participation . 
they are the supreme law of the land and in cases of conflict can be raised before the courts . 
before I get into the substance of my remarks , I also want to remind the House about the supply day motion itself and the process that brings us here today , which will culminate next week when the government will be asked for the authority to spend over $ 4 billion belonging to the people of Canada .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
it is our view that this country is going to have to achieve that balance or it is going to get increasing disrespect for the charter of rights and freedoms and the legal mechanisms used to enforce it . 
the government agrees with Justice Estey ' s vision that the western grain handling and transportation system should be made more efficient , more accountable and beneficial to farmers .

this House is not a democracy , it is anything but . 
she then proceeded to say that the government is addressing the problem by setting up an advisory board . 
we also say that the new west should use its new influence in the federation to address and resolve the problems of the federation as a whole , to get the federal financial house in order by insisting that tax and debt levels be lowered for all Canadians , by advocating that national health care - medicare , after all , was born in the west - be reformed for the benefit of all Canadians , by insisting that federal institutions be made more representative and democratically accountable for all Canadians , and by insisting that the equality of all Canadians and all provinces under the law become a governing constitutional principle throughout the entire country and be pounded into the heads of members of parliament . 
it is important that we be active in this area because our country , Canada , is neither the biggest nor the most powerful country in the world . 
the proposed legislation will also remove limitations on payments in lieu of taxes to first nations governments . 
what a beautiful country . 
our people in the Department of National Defence , whether civilian or military , are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards , and we are going to ensure that happens .

that would be a shame , unfair and undemocratic . 
i have talked about this many times before . 
the possibility of such referendums is not endangered by the clarity bill . 
the government showed its true colours . 
that is the way the government and the Government of British Columbia treated citizens not only in my constituency but right across the province . 
it is unfortunate because , throughout history , officials , members of conquered people , hastened to do the dirty work of the conquerors or their descendants . 
i reiterate my personal commitment . 
( division 155 ) 
the bill allows for the Minister of Health to promote and encourage public education and training of health care professionals in controlling pain and in palliative care . 
i will begin by congratulating two of my colleagues for the tremendous amount of work and time they have dedicated to the issue : the member for Crowfoot , who just yesterday reintroduced a private member ' s bill on this very issue ; and , the member for Surrey North , whose tragic life experiences and need to implement change in this area motivated him to actually run as a member of parliament . 
madam Speaker , the member for Wentworth - Burlington accused our member of toeing the party ' s line in speaking to Bill C - 9 at this point in time after his government and he toed the party line by voting to shut down debate in the House . 
today marks the eighty - second anniversary of the Halifax explosion . 
in view of the fact that Sergeant Kipling was given an honorary discharge , why does he continue to be charged in a military court ? 
that is why we implore members on the government benches but we also implore our colleagues on the opposition benches to participate with us in dealing with this issue in a reasoned , responsible , sensitive way , while none of us on this side of the House let the government off the hook on its responsibilities to Canadians . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
if you are able to relate personal information protection rules to an area of activity where federal authority is not in doubt , you have more chances to occupy the field , if I may put it this way . 
we took with us the findings which resulted from the discussions and the hearings that had taken place during the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform . 
how can she say to the House and all Canadians that everything is okay ? 
another change in the provision of health care in Canada is the shift throughout the country from a clinical model of delivering health to a residential model . 
we know that government is no friend of our Prime Minister .

honourable senators , I move the adoption of this report . 
question PERIOD 
the process has been flawed from the beginning . 
they want questions answered . 
the bill talks about increasing links , but it does not go as far as to enshrine the will to accomplish these links . 
i would like to underline that we do have a concern about the proposal and the impact upon the ABM treaty which is a very essential link in the broad arms control regime that we have . 
the one question I asked at every meeting was for it to tell us what it would do to improve the treaty process . 
we want the pardon system to be a real system . 
oak RIDGES MORAINE 
i commend the member for taking this issue forward . 
they are an important tool to coordinating services to the neediest in the aboriginal society . 
our Royal Assent ceremony brings them together for the final step in the sometimes lengthy process before a bill becomes law . 
it is clear that the supreme court ruling on the Marshall case has implications for the people of Atlantic Canada , both first nations and non - first nations . 
it is about losing a way of life that has existed in the country for generations . 
but Quebec already has such a plan . 
a negative vote on Motion No. 111 requires the question be put on Motion No. 112 . 
when closure is used we do not have the right to debate the issues and let Canadians knows about them . 
i submit that the people of Canada have had no true representation at the federal level .... With 
why do we have to continually wait and debate something on which there is a clear consensus and an absolute need ? 
the gap between the rich countries and the poor ones is widening .

Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
it will take about two minutes . 
it seems the federal government cannot accept the fact that Quebec has the best system in Canada and is adamant about imposing its legislation even if it means reducing the protection now enjoyed by Quebecers . 
the reality is that the Liberal track record has been about declining productivity and investment , record levels of taxation and punishing regulations and red tape .

i congratulate the government on his appointment . 
do you see what happens when we have what I have already termed phoney points of order ? 
these two are bound together in this one piece of legislation . 
some hon. members : 
i guess the best example of that is the byelection in Saskatoon - Rosetown - Biggar that was held on November 15 . 
madam Speaker , I am asking if the gentleman across the way is using parliamentary language when he accuses the Reform Party of purposely trying to mislead . 
from what I have heard and from what Senator Lynch - Staunton has said , that is not so at all . 
since 1989 , the number of poor children in Canada has increased by 60 % . 
offenders whose record include criminal acts of a sexual nature are therefore directly concerned by this legislative measure .

i am referring to the item at the very top of the list , that is , public debt charges of $ 42 billion for the fiscal year which begins on April 1 . 
i have mentioned previously and in my question today in question period , when a natural disaster strikes western Canada as in the case of the flooded areas in southwest Manitoba and southeast Saskatchewan , there is no declaration of a natural disaster . 
now that the deficit has been eliminated , when will the government be removing this tax ? 
some hon. members : 
the government keeps insisting that the burden to taxpayers is necessary and would cost the national treasury too much to change . 
for a number of years now , people on the government side have been saying that cuts in departmental spending are over . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
the Speaker : 
not everybody is . 
i also appeal to the Reform Party that despite the fact there should be a full debate on any issue in the House or in the committees , I do not think it should hold people involved in issues in other parts of the country hostage for its particular issue . 
we are developing with the provinces and territories a comprehensive strategy to improve the well - being of Canada ' s children with a special focus on the problems of low income families .

i will not read every word , just the general sense of the letter , if I may . 
he said there was an urgency to put more emphasis on health in Canada .

will the minister also give his commitment that all applications submitted from Newfoundland and Labrador will be given a fair assessment and that applications already rejected , such as the excellent ones from the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra and the Grand Concourse Authority , will be reviewed to make absolutely certain that no discrimination was involved ? 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 34 ( 1 ) , I have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , the report of the Canadian Group of the Interparliamentary Union .

after watching the aftermath of the supreme court decision , can there be any doubt that the government was totally and utterly ill prepared to respond to the violent reaction among fishers that such a decision was bound to create ? 
Mr. Speaker , because these clouds and allegations are hanging over his head , perhaps the wisest thing for the international trade minister to do would be to absolutely clear his name .

single parent families headed by women often live in poverty . 
this is all very lovely , but since I too am a member with a rural riding , I can confirm that , in 1999 , on the eve of the next millennium , there are taxpayers in Quebec - and in Canada as well , I am sure - who have party lines , and even some who do not have any telephone service at all . 
correct me if I am mistaken . 
i raised a question of privilege here in the Senate on April 23 , 1996 , under rule 43 ( 1 ) in respect of this letter . 
the government loves to govern by courts , not by parliament and not by letting elected officials make the decisions . 
if any money is to be invested in medical research , it must take the form of social transfer payments , so that we too can double our grants to researchers in our universities and medical research institutions .

Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , you have heard all the arguments . 
for the minister to state that the bill does not affect marriage is completely false and illogical in any form of reasoning . 
those memories , I share with Richard Greene . 
the next question is on Motion No. 20 . 
" budget 2000 New Era - New Plan " provides the road map to achieve that vision . 
we know full well that the legislation is full of holes that allow corporations as well as individuals to shamelessly contribute all they want to Canada ' s traditional political parties . 
how then can the minister explain his inaction ? 
i can think of the prebudget consultations , the Nisga ' a treaty and the free trade agreement . 
that is what I am talking about . 
perhaps those parties can come up with amendments to make this legislation meet the needs and objectives of the health care industry .

Canadians know that this government does not protect our civil servants . 
senator Kinsella : 
Mr. Speaker , regarding alternative service delivery the auditor general said that the Department of National Defence had real problems identifying baseline costs for projects , CFB Halifax being a case in point . 
financing of Post - Secondary Education 
senator Hays : 
Mr. Bernard Bigras : 
this is not just about giving the Mounties more money . 
it would update progress on the implementation of the unanimous recommendation that research be undertaken on requests for euthanasia in Canada . 
smart and industrious , these farmers are successful in a very difficult industry . 
it promises confusion , unfairness , and continuing and costly litigation . 
the government has put money into this program , but it is not working . 
it is never easy . 
early intervention would mean interceding early and perhaps preventing people from turning to crime or to some anti - social behaviour that might lead them to crime . 
our region is particular on the issue of genetic research . 
the hon. member suggests that we take up this issue with the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
how can we believe that we can retain capital in this country to create wealth , jobs and quality of living as long as we have this enormous and growing differential ? 
the decision that was handed down on September 17 by the supreme court left many unanswered questions . 
the government has to understand what we are saying about administration . 
treasury Board refused to meet with the union if the surplus was on the agenda , maintaining that it belonged in total to the government . 
it is absolutely true . 
there is a lot of money to be made in tourism , which is very useful for economic development . 
as some members from Alberta will know , there is a Chippewyan band right next to that plant . 
what I am offering is a positive solution to a situation , one that may have helped in a situation like this . 
Mr. Speaker , this bill amends the Immigration Act to ensure that those immigrants wishing to enter Canada have proper identification . 
the person who does not have money should have the same rights and powers with their elected official as the person who has power and influence . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 34 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
wisely , we have put in place a monitoring and assessment system so that every year we receive information about how that system is working . 
he led the CCF in the 1940 s and 1950 s . 
we are prosperous . 
members 
hon. Don Boudria 
we have been working with them . 
if I recall correctly , 1916 was in reference to regulation 17 in Ontario . 
the new VOR navigational system that was installed does not work . 
paired 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
i wonder what the Senate is doing and what its role is . 
hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
some hon. members : 
debates of the Senate ( Hansard ) 
through a motion passed on October 14 , 1999 , the House permitted that bills that had not yet received royal assent be reintroduced during the second session and , on October 18 , 1999 , what is now Bill C - 7 was passed by the House of Commons . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
that is why it is folly for negotiators to assume omniscience and produce voluminous treaties that attempt to cover every eventuality . 
that Vote 15 a in the amount of $ 42,963,667 , under SOLICITOR GENERAL - Correctional Service - Operating expenditures , in the Supplementary Estimates ( A ) for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2000 , be concurred in . 
that Bill C - 2 , in Clause 428 , be amended by adding after line 22 on page 177 the following : 
as I have said , rural Canadians face many challenges , a number of them quite similar from community to community , for example , the challenges presented by distance from markets , low population density and the cyclical nature of resource based industries . 
is it possible to legislate an end to the problem ? 
health 
that should be the lesson we take from the 1990 s . 
No. 
agreed . 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
the Nisga ' a treaty is complex . 
the focus of the member ' s speech could have been very specific . 
the bill is intended to make reasonable and workable amendments to both the Statistics Act and the National Archives of Canada Act to allow for the transfer of the census records from Statistics Canada to the National Archives of Canada where the records will be released to the public , subject to the Privacy Act . 
the only way to win against the modern version of organized crime is to work together , to create a common front made up of all members of parliament , an unbeatable common front because we will all stand united and determined in our fight against crime . 
the agriculture committee had hearings into genetically modified foods two years ago , long before it became the issue of the day . 
i declare Motion No. 199 lost . 
imagine when this figure climbs to 50 % and higher . 
Mr. Speaker , in spite of the hundreds of millions of dollars that the government spends on research and development , Canadian companies are still at the bottom of the heap when it comes to R and D spending . 
* * * 
i agree with one thing . 
members 
i look forward to supporting his bill , if it ever comes to the House for a vote . 
we can see that the government cares very little about democracy . 
when 72 % of Quebecers do not want either a referendum or independence and when our Prime Minister has held out his hand in a truce to Mr. Bouchard , I have one question for the Bloc Quebecois members : why does the leader of the Bloc and member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie not ask Mr. Bouchard to agree to the truce and to promise not to hold a referendum during his mandate ? 
one thing I do respect about the New Democrats is their consistency and sense of values and commitment to those values over a period of time . 
what is the agenda of the Liberals ? 
committees OF THE HOUSE 
they will also can that restricting third - party advertising will ensure that the electoral process is as transparent , democratic , and fair as possible . 
after his family , his municipality is the community with which he has the closest ties . 
* * * 
i have certainly seen nothing that would lead me to a similar conclusion . 
this shows the tremendous openness of this government . 
procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
division No. 110 
Mr. Jay Hill 
honourable senators , I also have grave concerns about clause 3 of the bill . 
what we are really dealing with is trafficking in human beings . 
those were provisions that I thought hung well together , and which did hang together very well in a single theme , but my friend Senator Graham and his then leader Senator MacEachen had some policy problems with the bill . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to applaud the member for West Nova for his intervention on this particular issue . 
i know there has been a great deal of discussion by some . 
this is only $ 1.6 billion or $ 1.3 billion on a space station . 
Mr. John McKay 
in my home province of New Brunswick , one family in six owns a woodlot . 
it is certainly not a point of order . 
if that is the case , let him say so , so that the issues involved are clear , so that we can understand , so that the matter is not dealt with between buddies and behind closed doors . 
all law enforcement agencies across the country are connected electronically , granting access to this program from the most remote reaches of Canada . 
from time to time in the House we come up with a common objective , a common agenda , and clearly the issue of organized crime in Canada is one that every member of the House should be very serious about . 
he is a real , honest to goodness hero . 
QUEBEC ' S MINISTER OF STATE FOR ECONOMY AND FINANCE 
honourable senators , my second repeat quotation is from Manitoba ' s Justice Carr in Thomas Plesh v. Wendy Ellen Plesh . 
i would like to advise the hon. member that I have been working 31 years for the homeless , for the poor and for the children of this country . 
* * * 
they were all lining up to receive grants in their ridings and that was their duty to do that . 
the facts are on the line . 
be authorized in advance by a neutral and impartial individual acting in a judicious manner ; be based on reasonable and probable grounds , not just suspicion , and be carried out in a reasonable manner , as opposed to an unreasonable one . 
motion No. 357 negatived 
no one , honourable senators , who comes from Western Canada , in particular the major agricultural areas of that region , can fail to hear , to see and to understand the pain and the insecurity of farm communities and farm families , of small rural towns and those who do business in them in the hard times , be they extremes of weather , of floods , of droughts , of disease , or the pressures of international trade which cause Canadian farmers to see the price for the best products in the world drop continuously in the face of massive subsidization in other nations . 
Davies , Dumas , Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis ) . 
we are ensuring that continues by virtue of the policies that are implemented in the House . 
that is just plain wrong . 
i do not remember the specific legislation . 
too much power has been vested in the Prime Minister and in his cabinet and not enough power is spread around to other members of the House . 
that is one thing that anyone who serves in a legislative chamber in any part of this country forgets at his or her peril . 
" force on June 1 , 2011 " 
national Defence 
members 
i have asked for amendments to the charter , to do something with a charter that allows this kind of thing to go on and on until it is worse and worse , where we have 11 and 12 year old kids being picked up on the streets because of prostitution . 
it shows what the House should be dealing with and what the government should be dealing with rather than what we are dealing with today . 
will the minister table in the House all of the exact details , including the time line of the Sea King replacement program that he has - 
Ottawa is everywhere . 
i predict that we will be facing a day of reckoning very soon as many more hundreds of millions of people make that realization , decide to pull up roots and do anything to get to the first world where they and their families might have an opportunity . 
senator Comeau : 
however , now that our point has been made I hope it will be acted on so that , whenever the time comes for other tax treaties , the officials responsible will go beyond the traditional drafting process and take into consideration the human rights record of that country to determine whether we should or should not carry on with an agreement . 
we heard from Leon Lueke , of the Saskatchewan Pork Producers ; Alfred Wagner , of the Pro - West Rally Group ; Noreen Johns , a passionate woman , deeply troubled , from the Saskatchewan Women ' s Agricultural Network ; Don Dewar , from Keystone Agricultural Producers ; George Groeneveld , from Agricore ; Wayne Motherall , from the Association of Manitoba Municipalities , which usually stays out of these kinds of issues , but since the small towns are hurting , the big ones are coming to help . 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Justice is telling Canadians that her proposed changes to the young offenders law will make young lawbreakers more accountable for their crimes . 
with respect to the particular grouping we are talking about , the issue of numbered companies contributing to political parties and candidates was put forward by the NDP as an amendment . 
in their current form , these regulations make ownership and lease financing not very attractive , even unprofitable . 
she correctly states that eastern political parties are walking on eggshells but she fails to recognize why . 
Mr. Speaker , the only group that ever gets information in a timely fashion is binder boy and Liberal MPs . 
let Quebec stay in Canada , and all will be well . 
the 1997 speech was just as vague in terms of commitments . 
i will have to hurry . 
why is the government hiding behind shared costs and respect for jurisdiction ? 
the proposed legislation would make it possible for this person , he or she , to propose changes to first nation policies and practices . 
i have also had calls that the Canadian Wheat Board is pressuring farmers over the cash advances they received in previous years . 
hon. Senators : 
i will not quote a number of former leaders of the movement who stated that openly and publicly . 
Mr. Charlie Penson : 
* * * 
honourable senators , seven programs were the subject of the audit . 
of course , the government is saying that there was already a commission , but it did not have the same status . 
i thank the government for helping me to get this part of the legislation right . 
if the federal government refuses to do so , if the minister fails to use his discretion , there is no sanction which those municipalities can impose upon us . 
we are clearly saying that we no longer want confusing questions like the one asked in 1995 . 
it seems to me that parliament would be shirking its duty if it said " Oh , we can ' t have anything to say about that because that is up to the seceding province . 
i am telling the government that it can no longer ignore our Nova Scotian farmers . 
i believe the committee will ultimately move to accept it and return it to the House . 
it is because of their commitment that the farm crisis issue is before the House today . 
honourable senators , I find what the minister has just said to be scandalous . 
the building was dedicated to the memory of the late Gordon Dawson , a potato producer who was a leader in the industry in growing and promoting quality spuds . 
it is not particularly controversial ; in fact it is anything but . 
canada ' s national security objectives must reflect Canadian security requirements . 
one of the things we have a problem with is that the minister and the crown agencies still maintain too much discretionary power . 
i asked by question very deliberately about competition problems in the gasoline industry , an issue clearly within the jurisdiction of the federal government and the Minister of Industry . 
this new section , between autoroute 50 and highway 307 , was funded by the Quebec department of transport and the Canadian department of transport , which shared the total cost of $ 14 million jointly . 
the debate will also allow us to debunk several myths regarding seasonal work . 
in April 1998 Dr. Christopher Ruhm of the University of North Carolina published a research paper entitled " Parental Leave and Child Health '' . 
in 1995 , one member of the Supreme Court Canada , Mr. Justice La Forest , said : 
" there are thousands of these cases , and they are coming in every day '' , said one Finance Department official . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
on December 6 , 1989 , a man , Marc L é pine , killed 14 women . 
do away with the groundhog ! 
the Speaker : 
he was kind enough to agree to sponsor me into this institution , and it will always be a matter of deep personal regret for me that he leaves now with my education barely begun . 
it is part of its job to lead us , as a nation , towards harmony and mutual respect . 
the ultimate way to effect a change is when the Department of Labour , which is more or less the supreme court of labour relations , imposes a vote in which the absolute majority applies , that is the 50 % plus one rule . 
i have been to the ILO with the Minister of Labour and have heard wonderful , grand , eloquent speeches that the Minister of Labour has given at the ILO , saying that this country supports the right to free collective bargaining so that workers can elevate their standards of wages and working conditions . 
the Mah é decision of 1990 took the courts into the operation of school boards . 
the Speaker : 
Devco employees have been fighting for over eight months to get the government to enhance the deal . 
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear why we will not listen to the Reform Party . 
Wiarton - Influence of Wiarton Willie on Community 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal 
this is what this treaty does . 
agriculture 
the hon. member may have a complaint about CSIS and of course with time we will judge whether or not that complaint is valid . 
honourable senators , the minister has talked about past efforts . 
if the bill goes forward , Canada will lag behind the rest of the world in mining production and related technologies . 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
when foreign countries see how much importance we attach to respecting people , to looking after their basic needs , when they see it is a priority for Canada they will respect us and we will have played a better role abroad than the one we play now by sending military equipment that is at times so heavy we lack the carriers needed to deliver them to a theatre of war abroad . 
a physical presence in the country for three years out of six is a good idea . 
the Saskatchewan government may have reservations about the existing program . 
why did the government shackle this committee ? 
delayed Answer to Oral Question 
here on in . 
that is like saying we are going to steal something because we expect the law to change to make that legal . 
as a Peace River grain farmer I continue to be a survivor of Canada ' s cheap food policies . 
yeas 
the Deputy Speaker : 
why should we expect them to have innate abilities in the face of death , simply because of their profession ? 
the figures speak for themselves . 
No. 
this is why I welcome the intervention by the Minister of Transport . 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
its purpose was to lay the initial groundwork for the structure and administration of a national DNA data bank . 
the low prices have been aggravated by the use of trade distorting support by some of our trading partners . 
a casual reading of the minister ' s speech might suggest that my words serve to support the argument he was making , but a more careful review of the record shows plainly that my words do not serve such a purpose . 
* * * 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
if the Speaker had better eyesight , I am sure he would chastise certain hon. members who are using cellphones in the Chamber . 
oh , oh . 
and , if so , when ? 
Mr. John Reynolds : 
did I ever say that NDP wants Canada to sever all its relations with its trading partners ? 
it is a far cry today from what it actually intended to be 30 years ago . 
be it resolved that the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs ( SCONDVA ) request the Government of Canada embark upon a five - year plan , commencing immediately , to substantially increase the budget of the Department of National Defence as a percentage of the GDP to revitalize , modernize and ensure an effective , combat capable Canadian Forces . 
" whereas reconciliation is best achieved through negotiation based upon the principles of equality , accountability and affordability ; " 
the minister said wait until the weather gets bad so the ships stop coming . 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
in his reform , Minister Rochon wanted to bring all primary care into the CLSCs . 
that may be drastic , but in reality that is a step that will allow the cod to recover , that will allow the fishery on the east coast to recover and that will allow the families in that part of the world to get back on the water to make a living so that they generate food for the rest of Canada . 
senator Austin , as Chair , had a difficult task . 
canada will work to preserve our right to choose how to market our agricultural products . 
governor in council is a fancy word for the Prime Minister of Canada . 
oh , oh . 
i believe the point has been made on both sides at this point . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 138 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
the Chair is very reluctant to keep putting the question on such points of order . 
they were passed on to the minister . 
however , I will not support any opportunity for deviants or would - be deviants in the health care field . 
some hon. members : 
honourable senators , it is critical to global security that the NPT survive until a comprehensive plan for eliminating all nuclear weapons is negotiated . 
she will find that there were perhaps some words that were not completely parliamentary . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
* * * 
i think the Bloc comes to this issue with a point of view of perhaps some negative experience in this area and the problems around organized crime . 
unfortunately some people voiced their frustration in ways that were not very kind . 
i respectfully submit that if the Chair wishes to be able to judge the relevance of remarks made with respect to the proposed amendment , my colleague must be allowed to develop his argument in order to make the relevant point . 
they are always alone and they do not have time to see all the contracts . 
Mr. Speaker , the inquiry is doing its job and one of the things it turned up was this evidence from RCMP Superintendent Wayne May , who said , and I will quote again , " The Prime Minister of our country is directly involved '' . 
there will be a certain amount of kibitzing back and forth , but if there is any meanness in the kibitzing it could deteriorate very quickly . 
it is unfortunate that the government rests on what has been done in the past and does not recognize the reality before us today . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to congratulate and commend Molson for its outstanding effort to support the community and help save our great Ottawa Senators hockey team . 
in the minister ' s five principles that he brought out on day 45 of the 90 - day process , one of the principles he stated very clearly was that regional service must be guaranteed . 
we are talking about areas of environmental regulations . 
the words " handicap " and " infirmity " are seen as inappropriate or obsolete and the word " disability " seems more appropriate . 
the federal government could easily decide that in a province - namely Quebec - where legislation protecting personal information already exists , it applies and even federally regulated businesses are subject to it . 
the industry minister says let the provinces do it . 
could the member expand on that element of his remarks ? 
that is what it is about . 
Mr. Philip Mayfield 
however , if we look at it more closely , it could very well be real grants . 
that is not the solution . 
Mr. Peter MacKay 
the Deputy Speaker : 
pursuant to rule 97 ( 3 ) , I move that the report be placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration at the next sitting of the Senate . 
issues such as the following ones were agreed to . 
i am hopeful that in this instance , since there is no debate about the desirability of the bill , perhaps the government will allow the committee to function as committees were designed to function and let it actually have some real input into the legislation , instead of having the whip sneak over to make sure that the good little boys and girls do not stray . 
that is because they do not believe in these kinds of programs . 
i again thank Senator Lynch - Staunton for bringing forward this debate because Royal Assent is a matter of the constitution of this place . 
some hon. members : 
yet in our hearts I think we all have some understanding of its nature . 
* * * 
i salute him again and I hope his call for help , his work and his bill will be favourably received by the governing party , the Liberal Party . 
leave having been given to revert to Government Notice of Motions : 
i do not know whether he realized this fact after he wrote his letter of resignation and then it was too late , but today he will make some Liberal in Alberta very happy . 
Mr. Derek Lee : 
i agree in principle with everything the honourable senator said about the disconnection between government policy and human rights violations , and how one can link those in a useful way to bring some moral suasion on an offending state . 
hear , hear . 
earlier today we heard Reform members and other members who participated at the committee talk about how seriously we took the process at committee in terms of amendments and discussions with no credence or support from the Liberal members on that committee for that kind of participation . 
* * * 
why did it have to cease business ? 
i had many sessions with Alf over the years , but after coming here in 1993 as a member on the government side and as a member of the standing committee on agriculture , it was not unusual at all to see Alf in his older years sitting in the agricultural committee room listening to the hearings . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Bill Graham : 
we have $ 106 billion to spend . 
stricter eligibility checks on licence holders and applicants is one piece of evidence . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
i look forward to accepting their work in the near future . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
i have a feeling this bill was introduced for very practical reasons and not for reasons relating to the referendum . 
in a democratic society , it is unacceptable that legislation should deliberately create two classes of citizens . 
nays 
some hon. members : 
freshwater fish have to be fresh . 
let us not forget that prior to the Young Offenders Act in 1984 there was a predecessor statute which dealt with young offenders . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
they have a right to dream . 
we are asking the government to look at the hiring of returning officers on the basis of merit , not on the basis of political affiliation , which would make the process more transparent and more accountable , particularly since the returning officers will not be casting the deciding vote in the event of a tie because the government has changed that provision . 
second , if the income is still taxable in both countries , by demanding that the country of residence deem the income to be tax exempt or granting a credit for the tax paid in the country where the income was generated . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
i understand full well the benefits and consequences of our social system . 
the preferences that exist right across the country to attract and grow that sector are amazing . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
when people do not want to resolve a problem , they close their eyes to solutions of any sort , or they come up with all sorts of arguments against . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) moved : 
it is about time that we began to address the issue here . 
this is highway robbery . 
the next question is on Motion No. 128 . 
Mr. Speaker , recent research has shown that women are adversely affected in many ways by home care because of the amount of care they do in the home in unpaid work . 
we must work together with the stakeholders to develop a clear blueprint for Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century . 
No. 
creating a form of self - government whose structure takes into account existing traditions , concretely recognizing ancestral territories , developing new skills , taking stock of the natural resources that will help generate wealth , promoting " identity - based " conservation measures through the normal and minimum institutions that allow a community to control its destiny , maintaining bridges based on cooperation and sharing , these are all reasons for us to be reassured . 
without concern for his career prospects , Maj. Buonamici conducted a full investigation of the incident in March , 1993 , when soldiers of the now disbanded Canadian Airborne Regiment captured a Somalia teenager , torturing and killing him . 
i marvelled at the technology . 
however , as we have seen with the way the Liberal government has misused Canadians ' employment insurance money , we cannot trust the Liberal government to use Canadians ' money for what it is intended . 
the Speaker : 
that said , he always remained loyal to caucus discipline , which qualifies him as a good Liberal . 
in response to my question , he said it was not an instruction to the committee . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai 
Mr. Bernard Bigras 
the atmosphere is one of indifference rather than of respect for an event which , while largely a formality , is nonetheless an essential one and reminds us of the evolution of the parliamentary system over the centuries . 
national DEFENCE 
agreed . 
that is understandable and the fact is one does not have to earn an enormous salary to be in that bracket , which brings me back to the brain drain . 
Ottawa is so far away and so disjointed from the way we feel in the province of British Columbia that we simply cannot get through to the people here , in particular the Liberal federal government . 
before he imposes a referendum question , is the minister aware that all the parties represented in the National Assembly oppose intervention by the federal government on this issue ? 
pursuant to Standing Order 109 of the House of Commons the committee requests the government to table a comprehensive response to these two reports . 
i think a simple " No " is all that is required if leave is not forthcoming . 
costing proposals is a basic responsibility of the public service . 
it is said that such things date back to the time of Marc Lalonde , a Liberal Minister of Finance . 
user pay is politically acceptable . 
social awareness of the need to make a conscious and deliberate choice to donate one ' s organs at the time of death brings us to the point where we can acknowledge the importance of a national organ donor registry . 
an hon. member : 
therefore , it is not accurate to suggest that the treaty does not provide for individual property rights or that residents will be exposed to arbitrary decisions of Nisga ' a government . 
canada ' s philosophy concerning relations is based on notions of freedom of association and free collective bargaining , no micromanagement . 
it is very simple and straightforward . 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais 
the prognosis is certain death . 
we took our responsibilities seriously , we were prepared -

i want to say to the member that this issue will unfold . 
a rescue beacon inadvertently left a chopper on September 24 while it was flying over central Maine . 
the cutback in federal funding to the provinces for health care is causing problems today in hospitals and emergency rooms from one part of the country to another . 
i ask the hon. member to remove the prop from the House . 
senator Comeau : 
members of that committee should be involved . 
in fact , I believe that the process of designing and determining the information is underway now . 
they did not say that . 
we should be downsizing the number of politicians we have in the House of Commons and eliminate the Senate . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 443 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
i am not suggesting for a minute that we should be picking out pieces of this carcass . 
Mr. Speaker , over the past two days , a number of events have taken place in this House . 
the Evolving Role of the Federal Government in Support of Culture in Canada '' , which was tabled in the House of Commons in June . 
this position would have the same credibility as the auditor general . 
i think about the united alternative conference to which I unfortunately was dispatched as a representative , as a spy for the Liberal Party . 
we must give this issue the same respect it would receive if it were happening in Ontario or Quebec or , frankly , downtown Vancouver . 
my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources . 
the Senate ' s equation has traditionally been based on equality , and it is in this light that Bill C - 20 must be studied . 
( the House adjourned at 7.17 p.m. ) 
senator De Ban é : 
canada ' s contribution will , among other things , assist the victims of violence and provide them with the very much needed food and shelter .

in addition to a long reference period , negative margins must be factored in to the AIDA calculation . 
the government is raising taxes when we are already the highest taxed country of all of our major trading partners , one of the highest taxed in the world and they are still going up . 
if this bill did not exist , the Senate would have no role to play with respect to negotiations . 
businesses that are interested in economic development opportunities on Nisga ' a lands will know from the final agreement that the Nisga ' a own these lands . 
i have already ruled on that point . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te 
it is in the name of this same humanism that every effort must be made to fight organized crime . 
Mr. Speaker , to you , to the Prime Minister and to all members of the House , I extend an invitation to visit the most exciting place in Canada , Blue Mountain Resorts . 
Mr. Lynn Myers 
Mr. Speaker , we recognized that a long time ago . 
John has seen the light .

we are in one of these processes . 
is there unanimous consent to proceed in this way ?

i am not aware at the present time of any change to current government policy , but I will inquire of the Minister of Health to ensure that I am up - to - date on that topic . 
i declare Motion No. 187 lost . 
what issue is that ? 
also dealing with jurisdictional issues , there are a number of legislative areas in which the Nisga ' a government enjoys paramountcy over the federal and provincial laws and some areas where in cases of conflict " the federal or provincial laws of general application will prevail . " 
of course we do . 
there are 1,100 workers involved . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal 
four committees are stuck with this schedule , including Foreign Affairs , Banking , Social Affairs and Legal and Constitutional Affairs . 
i do not think there is anything in it so far that I have read to members of the House that will significantly change the country of Canada that we all live in . 
he based this on an OECD report to the effect that Canada was lamentably behind in this area . 
will the minister finally admit that he and his officials opened the door to Onex , failing which Mr. Schwartz would never have gone ahead with his offer ?

his role is not taken seriously . 
for infractions , reasonable grounds are required , while for national security a mere suspicion would suffice .

it is not just material dependency . 
the second element that interests me is that the audit brings to the floor of this chamber the very fundamental issue of whether or not we support these programs .

if we do not provide some form of governance with which this group can identify , they will continue to move into gangs as their alternative to aboriginal governance . 
while I am sure all of Canada is enjoying the theatrics of the member from Kamloops , he is absolutely misrepresenting - 
motion No. 368 
hon. Don Boudria 
i declare Motion No. 240 lost . 
members of the House will recall what occurred at the end of the last session . 
we must understand that point . 
Mr. John Nunziata : 
hon. Jim Peterson 
agreed . 
when I receive that report it will be evaluated . 
Mr. Gary Lunn 
he cannot say that he did not know . 
unfortunately , I cannot comment on it in detail today . 
( division 269 ) 
although the motion does not talk about the use of information to create safer work environments , it is important to keep in mind that education and awareness are also important aspects of our existing approach to promoting workplace safety . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 30 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
positive , yes , because the Liberals are quite happy to have had free trade . 
the Liberals must know that the bill does not have a chance of withstanding a constitutional challenge but I believe they have an ulterior motive in introducing the bill . 
it is merely a simulated election . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the foreign affairs minister has no business calling for Pakistan to be expelled from the Commonwealth following the military takeover . 
the Speaker : 
i do not want to oversimplify but , generally speaking , I think it is fair to say that those organizations in the health care field whose activity is clearly and indubitably commercial are opposed to this bill , and they seek an exemption for the entire health care sector from the provisions of this bill . 
that is an insult to the 60,000 employees , both francophone and anglophone , who work hard for Canadian Airlines . 
he says : 
HELLENIC REPUBLIC 
Mr. Speaker , do you know what Canadians accept ? 
let us get serious . 
this is not to say that anyone is being intimidated , but members can just imagine how lonely we would feel all alone in a corner and then finding out that our jobs had been on the line . 
the Internet is an explosive new material in terms of media . 
that is what I am aware of . 
hon. David M. Collenette :

bill C - 247 . 
the main reason I wanted to introduce this motion is the recent changes to the employment insurance plan . 
i would ask hon. members to stay away from the word misleading . 
yes , we can live together , in equality and difference . 
in order to capture the minds and the hearts of people , we must work collaboratively with the NGOs . 
as honourable senators can see very clearly , Bill S - 12 is an act to amend the Divorce Act ( child of the marriage ) . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
a rate of 10 per cent will apply to interests and royalties , again with some few exceptions for interests and royalties on software , patents and know - how . 
the paragraph that I just read gives Parliament the power , which it may choose to exercise , but in the Nisga ' a case this has not been done , as the rest of the letter makes clear . 
honourable senators , leave has not been granted . 
honourable senators , I should like to return to the question of indivisibility . 
some do so willingly , others must be encouraged . 
many of our veterans do not have access to military standards of health care either because the health care responsibilities have already been devolved to particular provinces , or because a disbelieving military , fearful of being seen to favour large numbers of disability claims , denies at the outset that the veteran ' s health problems relate in any way to his or her term of military service . 
we are moving forward on this issue . 
look where it has left native people in the country . 
it is not the Reform Party ' s money . 
honourable senators , I believe the motion in amendment would help the committee because it would show the will of the Senate to encourage the ministers to come to the committee . 
the history of Canadian democracy , despite its failures and dark chapters , can be put up against democracy in any other countries . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
the issue is very clear . 
i love each one of them very much , just as I love my other five children who are non - native . 
paired 
the main objectives of Canada ' s international activities are to promote Canadian values and policies while building a strong network for practical co - operation . 
could the Minister of Canadian Heritage explain how this commitment made a decade ago will be fulfilled ? 
we have always said that it is better to bring this information to the House , but I suggest to the hon. member that over the course of the next few days he will have ample opportunity in question period and by other means to question the minister involved . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
there is a crisis in the country , both for people who heat their homes with oil and for people who run these large trucks . 
let me explain what I mean by that . 
it was because of their attitude , as the hon. member just showed . 
these are the problems that exist . 
NISGA ' A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell : 
Mr. Speaker , Reform Party members will vote yes to this motion . 
the Speaker : 
the reality is that although the federal government collects volumes of money from gasoline and other fuel taxes , it puts virtually no money into the highway system . 
i hope I am wrong but I do not think I will be . 
it did not put up a fight in regard to these land claims . 
agreed . 
on every front , government policy is the reason for the growing gap between poor and wealthy Canadians . 
however , we continue to witness the reluctance of the federal government to take action to set such standards . 
returning officers and poll clerks should be selected on the basis of ability , experience and impartiality and these positions should be publicly advertised . 
these are three very distinguished Canadians who are actively involved in trying to bring together the two sides in that process . 
therefore , I hope that the members of the Liberal Party and the other parties will think about our electoral system and , at the same time , about our whole system of democratic representation . 
i wish to remind him that , in this House , the opposition party that has most often voted with the government when bills were appropriate is the Bloc Quebecois . 
the member ' s solution to the immigration crisis is to make an educational video and send that across the waters to folks so that they know to please not come because we are not sure what to do with them when they get here . 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the first report of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations . 
we now know that this political decision has done irreparable damage to the Canadian economy . 
hon. David M. Collenette 
Mr. Peter Mancini 
the honourable senator rightly pointed out something with which I agree , which is that you should look to see whether a country is doing better or attempting to do better on its human rights record , or is regressing . 
that she will call the attention of the Senate to the decision of the Government of Ontario not to adopt a recommendation to declare the City of Ottawa bilingual following its proposed restructuration . 
it is located about one hour north of Victoria , British Columbia , on beautiful Vancouver Island . 
when the federal government says it must look at the criteria , examine the program and find ways to make the program work , we have to accept that this approach has some validity . 
of the more than 3,000 people who today sit on waiting lists , 150 or more of them will die needlessly . 
the minister has been caught . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) : 
he has fought tenaciously for access rights because he believes that he can be a good influence in the child ' s life . 
it will continue to have an RCMP detachment there once the treaty takes effect . Nothing in the treaty prevents the Mounties or the provincial police from enforcing federal and provincial laws on Nisga ' a land . 
i think the history of the negotiations of the Nisga ' a land question shows very clearly that the Nisga ' a are quite capable of making up their own minds , as they have . 
we are seeing a very proactive and inclusive approach which will allow our current justice system to blend with this new system of justice . 
* * * 
the reaction coming from the province that borders on Canada ' s largest group of French - speaking Canadians is unbelievably insensitive . 
in addition , a Western Union internal memo once stated that the telephone had too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication . 
Mr. Jim Gouk 
nays 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously the member and his party have not been listening . 
i can assure my hon. colleague that the RCMP is working with all police forces across the country to apprehend this individual as soon as possible . 
the federal government , in order to be fair , has for a number of years voluntarily paid a fair assessment to the different municipalities . 
in his speech , Senator Furey spoke of the adjustment now in progress in his province of Newfoundland and Labrador . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i can indeed hear him and I would ask him to speak directly to his point of order so that I may give a ruling . 
he said he was delighted with the court ' s decision . 
we also believe that the age of consent should be dealt within the broader context of other age related issues in the criminal code . 
routine PROCEEDINGS 
in other words , cabinet will decide who these people are . 
she concluded by saying " Why allow what is unjustified ? 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur 
the Reform Party recommended that Canadian pensions be cut . 
aboriginal women must be protected in the case of marriage breakdown , and , as in most cases they have custody of children , they must be assured of adequate housing . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , Lib . ) : 
would he agree with the solicitor general of Ontario who two weeks ago said that the government should scrap the national gun registry and put more police on the street to fight organized crime and some of these other things ? 
Mr. Speaker , it is unfortunate that the Minister of Finance did not answer my question . 
motion No. 322 
the present minister proposes recovery of misspent funds . 
again , I think it has to happen in scientific research . 
you are a block head . 
i take on the responsibility of becoming Canada ' s 26 th Governor General since Confederation , fully conscious of the deep roots of this office , stretching back , to the Governors of New France and to the first of them , Samuel de Champlain . 
we are unable at this time to give actual position titles . 
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to table the documents ? 
again it was last April , almost a year ago , when this was said . 
Mr. Peter Goldring 
we must accommodate the changing demands of our aging and increasing population . 
inter - Parliamentary Group 
he talked about breaking the old mould . 
Mr. Speaker , on Monday tens of thousands of Albanians faced a crowd of Serbs across the bridge that spans the Ibar River in the divided city of Mitrovica . 
we need some help and assistance in that , but let us get real . 
it is important to understand the components of the plan because they take into consideration that tax cuts should not only cater to a section of Canadian society . 
nay .

national Defence 
as long ago as 1979 , the Trudeau government , through its then Minister of Justice , Mr. Jean Chr é tien , made a commitment in a constitutional policy statement that the right to privacy would be one of those rights that the federal government proposed to enshrine in any future charter of rights and freedoms . 
to quote one of the members , we all put " a little water in our wine " to achieve unanimity . 
we are building the workforce for the 21 st century and we will continue to participate with private sector partners who are willing to leverage our money . 
i keep forgetting whether it is his party or the NDP party , they are so intermingled these days . 
naturally we are told that the institutes will have to work from four perspectives , in each case : basic biomedical activities , clinical research activities , health services and systems and impacts on society , culture and public health .

first , third parties have a right to participate in the electoral process . 
i spent some time in Vancouver and other parts of British Columbia , Kamloops , Okanagan , Shuswap and Vancouver Island , because , as the hon. member said , my oldest son and his family , my two grandsons , live there and I have a brother who lives there . 
in that regard , we have three very specific concerns . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay 
not the way you handle it . 
Mr. Ren é Laurin 
such initiatives are essential if Canada and Canadians are to be able to participate fully in the opportunities offered by the Internet and e - commerce . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i do not have the specific information with respect to the situation in all of the provinces , but I will certainly get the available information and supply it to the honourable senator . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 217 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
reason must prevail . 
they indicated that the government had never approached them . 
i will only give one example . 
however , they were quick to change their tune , especially last week , when they showed how inflexible they are and unwilling to accommodate Quebec within their system . 
motion No. 396 negatived 
i do not know if most people realize this , but there are two books that deal only with the Nisga ' a agreement . 
yet the crown allowed and the government allowed that fish could be included as a trading commodity . 
honourable senators , I have a response to a question raised on February 24 of this year by Senator Ruck regarding provisions of the Naval Service Act and a response to a question raised on March 1 , 2000 by Senator Tkachuk regarding Budget 2000 , long - term benefits to taxpayers .

drugs are authorized for sale in Canada once they have successfully gone through the drug review process . 
surely impaired people , who voluntarily put alcohol in their systems and get behind the wheel and go out on the highway and kill someone , have to be dealt with very harshly under the current provisions of the criminal code . 
practitioners sometimes resort to drugs not approved in Canada for the treatment of serious or life - threatening illnesses , when conventional treatments have been unsuccessful or are not appropriate . 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition has been signed by people all across the country . 
we are asking all parties to embrace and support it because it provides additional transparency with respect to who is giving money to political parties and candidates . 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
clearly that was mistake number one . 
the project identified was twofold : building the boardwalk and clearing up the waterfront area , which has now turned it into a tourist attraction .

i too would have concerns about the possibility that a space station could lead to another space station and that some rivalry could take place in space . 
perhaps we can take this as an oral question to be answered at a later date . 
because of the neglect of the physical plant and the disregard for its current needs , according to a report in The Daily Gleaner , the Greater Fredericton Airport Authority has been informed by its consultants that a $ 20 - million investment is required to bring the airport up to present standards , or standards that are required now , shall we say . 
let us reform the budget so that some day the working poor will pay no income tax , so that some day seniors on fixed incomes will no longer fear the taxman coming , so that some day all taxpayers will pay the same percentage rate of taxation , so that some day the federal government will live within modest means and help rather than hurt , and so that some day we will have viable universal medicare for everyone . 
many members from rural British Columbia have repeatedly spoken against the deal in the House . 
the war against poverty , begun barely ten years ago , has been such a total failure that the mayors of major Canadian cities describe it as a national disaster . 
it has not done anything .

public awareness is the key to tackling the issue of transplant shortages in this country .

farm Crisis in Prairie Provinces - Response of Government 
these residents of British Columbia would like to send a petition to the attention of the House of Commons to abolish nuclear weapons . 
Mr. Ren é Laurin 
it is great to see members on the other side helping us because they do not have elected people on the prairies and in rural ridings to help communicate that message to the cities . 
( b ) by adding after line 18 on page 102 the following : 
here we are , the NAFTA cheerleaders again , after the government said to the people of Canada that if it was elected it would not proceed with the NAFTA as it was currently written , and it did . 
moderate livelihood is defined as including such basics as food , clothing and housing supplemented by a few amenities , but not the accumulation of wealth . 
introduction and first reading 
nobody else in Canada has the right to a constitutionally protected business and it should not be created in this treaty . 
moreover , there are no plans to purchase or use such ammunition in the future . 
the government has up to now said that the weak exchange rate of the Canadian dollar encourages exports . 
the next question is on Motion No. 234 . 
it is an article published in the February 18 , 2000 issue of Le Soleil entitled " Bill C - 20 '' . 
the Supreme Court is not talking about clarity of question and clarity of majority ; it is talking about negotiations . 
first and foremost , we understand categorically that any time a large capital good is purchased in Canada or anywhere in the world the available financial package is a cornerstone of whether or not the bid is competitive . 
on the Order : 
there is still much to be done . 
let them ask a clear question , out of respect for Quebecers and their rights as sovereign citizens of a democratic country . 
we saw the Prime Minister in a corridor with his cellphone , and Sharon Carstairs , one of his buddies , was there working against the accord . 
as a matter of fact , I rode in from Toronto this morning with a young man who says he has always been a Liberal but is totally disgusted as he watches all these corporations being scooped up by Americans and others virtually at half price . 
as the fortunes of the Clark government sank to an all - time low in public esteem , the polls showed a modest decline in support for the agreement .

the Supreme Court of Canada did not say whether the aboriginal tax free status which exists would reduce needed fishery earnings . 
in the U.S. the percentage of trade is 12 % of its gross domestic product . 
Mr. Speaker , the minister is using the supreme court opinion as he sees fit . 
Mr. Art Hanger : 
the fact that some of our European ancestors felt free to treat Indians as an inconvenient life form to be displaced in the name of progress does not make me guilty of anything . 
Gordon Gibson , a former advisor to Mr. Trudeau and a former Liberal leader in the province of British Columbia , has written " Small governments with large powers may acquire the ability to control the citizens rather than the other way around '' .

CANADIAN ECONOMY 
honourable senators , I should like to add a very few words to the debate . 
consequently , honourable senators , I recommend that we move ahead and vote on the motion . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
rights OF YOUTH 
members 
i would like to speak on the key issues here , which are the amount of Canadian ownership and control in any industry in Canada and the question of competition and service . 
( division 690 ) 
i think my colleague would agree that is not the point she is making at this time . 
consider the recent Air India hijacking , the kidnapping last year of eight Albertan oil workers in Ecuador , the insidious influence of the illicit drug trade on young Canadians , the impact on Canada of the global traffic in human cargo , and the spectre of terrorist activity in our country . 
a byproduct of this technological revolution is that supervising our rights takes on a new dimension of responsibility . 
may I ask a question ? 
people are abusing immigration laws and the criminal code . 
he is entitled to as much protection from the Canadian government as other producers get in other countries with whom he has to be in competition . 
i hardly need to reiterate that the Nisga ' a final agreement was duly endorsed by the three parties that negotiated it . 
things are not good when the one person who could do something does not dare do so for fear of being criticized . 
its objective is to cause unreasonable delays . 
honourable senators , under " Government Business " , I request that the Senate deal first with No. 3 , the second reading of Bill C - 20 . 
i consider it my privilege to rectify both the facts and the reproaches relating to the carrying out of my legitimate duties as a member of parliament coming from the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
as the Minister of Transport has stated , the government will go further and assess whether these provisions should be broadened to address market dominance . 
before this project can proceed , we are insisting that it be subject to a comprehensive and credible environmental impact study with input from both countries . 
people would not hire a swarthy Mediterranean type .

members 
bill C - 272 . 
why did he not answer the question on why the Reform Party opposed the national child tax benefit ? 
like Senator Kirby and Senator Murray , I am generally supportive of Bill C - 6 . 
we are expected to shrug our shoulders and say " Look what they negotiated for us today '' . 
they should make it pretty clear . 
clearly technology investment is a thoughtful investment for the future of a strong Canadian federation and a strong Canadian youth . 
this is probably one of the most important debates that we will have in the House for some time dealing with the future of the country . 
the committee should have travelled throughout Canada and people should have been able to talk to the government and opposition parties about the bill but that did not happen . 
what a lame excuse . 
national DEFENCE 
definitions of " children " and " vulnerable persons " are now in the bill . 
the kind of legislation we have had presented to us and which is contained within Bill C - 3 does nothing to change that particular conclusion . 
senator Forrestall : 
we are advancing this debate . 
no other province has one and it is possible that no state in the United States has such an organization . 
people from across western Canada have been crying for this for years . 
honourable senators , I wish to thank the honourable senator for her question . 
we Canadians in the IPU continue this work . 
is it right for us to invest in communities in Quebec to ensure the their citizens have opportunities to work ? 
Mr. Ted White 
yeas 
it is not perfect , of course , and we are trying to improve it , but I think the rest of Canada should have followed this example . 
from my interpretation , there is no violation whatsoever of the prerogative . 
we will hear from witnesses . 
he died behind the Chateau Laurier in the shadow of Parliament Hill . 
fellow Canadians who are successful on the world stage make us feel good about ourselves and serve as role models for others . 
we want to see a national housing strategy . 
it is still a struggle , as the modern version of the family compact sits just right of the Speaker , still content to try and fiddle with the rules to give the governing party the advantage and to prescribe condescendingly what is good for the voter and prescribe how voters need to be controlled and managed . 
in some instances , problems have been deliberately incorporated in the plan . 
Mr. Speaker , if it is just a trip across the river , I imagine the committee could manage it too . 
depleted uranium is a nuclear weapon that does not discriminate . 
there is a growing Canadian consensus that this is the right approach , that this balanced approach is the Canadian way . 
this is how . 
Mr. Maurice Dumas 
would he then go on to explain to his buddies in the hockey dressing room and to his mom and dad that he really is not gay , he just had a cavity ?

on December 21 , 1999 , the world lost the loving wife of David , the devoted mother of Jay , Jordan , Spencer and Matthew , the daughter and sister of the Tubin family and , as well , a good friend to many of us .

if that is the number one priority in capital equipment , as Minister Collenette has said , why is there no reference to it in the budget ?

hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
poverty is quietly but constantly increasing , while at the same time the economy is growing without seeming to have any impact on society . 
honourable senators , at the same time would the minister find out for us what his government ' s position is on China ' s stated policy that there are only five recognized religions in China which , by the way , does not include , among others , Judaism ? 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
now , the federal government wants to privatize those airports , which already are not viable . 
madam Speaker , that is how the article reads , and I asked permission to read the article , but I will refer to the Minister of Transport . 
my job as minister is to shore up this foundation , to make sure it is strong , because when a foundation shifts or is weakened , that which it holds up can also become weakened . 
i acknowledge the other programs the Leader of the Government mentioned , but the most important program is our hospitals . 
that is a debate that might perhaps lead to the 21 st century . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
the Canada we now live in would no longer be . 
we are asking the government to reconsider that approach and to help our farmers as soon as possible .

canada calls on the Russian Federation to honour its commitments made at the Istanbul summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow the OSCE to undertake a role in finding a political settlement to the crisis in Chechnya through peaceful negotiations . 
the entire country was shocked with the murder of Reena Virk in 1997 . 
hon. Jane Stewart 
there are many ways that the Liberal government has hurt people on the low end of the income scale and I have recounted them . 
so long as the government does not correct the situation , there will be a pall over all of the House of Commons . 
can she explain to us why her predecessor did not sign such a letter ? 
oh , oh . 
the privilege of a member to speak here is neither negotiable nor transferable , and neither is it transferable between members . 
i have a whole list of bills that were promised and have yet to come . 
that may seem a little strong , but I want to explain this over the next few minutes to see if there are not some members who might agree with me . 
the Kremlin has been refurbished to the tune of U.S. $ 350 million and it is a building of which Russia can be proud . 
it is really having a hard time understanding the Quebec reality . 
in addition , by the mere fact of their existence , tax conventions will create a climate of certainty and stability for investors and marketers . 
yet the government seems prepared or more than willing to put money into companies that are already making money . 
that the committee have the power to permit coverage by electronic media of its public proceedings ; and 
to make it even more remarkable , in addition to his very successful law practice during that period , he was and is very active in the affairs of the Liberal Party of Canada . 
old ideas need to be questioned , including the notion of the primacy of state sovereignty and territorial integrity . 
the Nisga ' a disagreement is the most important and the worst social and economic legislation and constitutional amendment in my lifetime . 
honourable senators , I give notice that on Monday , December 13 , 1999 , I will move : 
i urge the minister to reconsider all plans to further downgrade and denigrate these historical and practical lighthouses in the province . 
i do not think their role is high enough and prominent enough in the consultation process . 
that is an important readjustment in the current statute . 
well , that can wait .

in the old days , when some small change was to be made on the reserve , people had to contact the liaison officer in Ottawa to find out if it was allowed . 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire 
when I hear from the Progressive Conservative Party I feel a little saddened to see that once great national party take the kind of positions that it does and play the kind of divisive game it has chosen to play on this piece of legislation . 
it should not be appointments by the government . 
motion No. 109 agreed to 
motion No. 79 could have devastating consequences for doing business in Canada . 
regarding trade , I outlined the only approach that can be made . 
for the initial consideration of some 250 pages of text , before Bill C - 2 is referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , 301 parliamentarians will have a total of 180 minutes : three hours of debate . 
when a young person takes another person ' s life , steals the rest of that person ' s life , the 50 or 75 years ahead , it seems inappropriate to me that sometimes we hand out sentences of three years or five years , but so often that is the case . 
the Marshall decision , which was clarified by the supreme court , is finally getting through the fog and coming to the middle ground . 
i would like to ask the solicitor general , sitting in a back seat and not attending to the matter , whether he will finally take some disciplinary action and suspend the agent and the director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service .

the fact is that in many urban settings organized crime is preying on young people and utilizing some as young as the age of 10 years to pursue crime because it realizes there is a loophole in the law by utilizing young people . 
as for the GST , I was not much in favour of that as a businessman , and many people in Canada were also opposed . 
even the infamous Red Book conceded that .

some hon. members : 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) : 
the government has been on the record as saying that the job situation in the proposed merger of Canada Trust by the Toronto - Dominion Bank will be of paramount interest to the government . 
these people draft contracts ; they are in regular contact with governments and private corporations when they sign contracts . 
some would call it the brain drain . 
the Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , here again the opposition continues on this firing and resignation treadmill . 
we are getting there just as quickly as we can . 
i suspect they believe what the Reform Party has said , that this could somehow be interpreted as a template for separation .

this bill concerns the creation of a network of national marine conservation areas , the marine equivalent of national parks . 
he is correct when he says that I am under pressure to spend more time in the province . 
there was nothing for maritimers . 
they were thrilled about it . 
it has failed to show Canadian people a true commitment to providing for the country , to ensuring that the dollars are going where they should be going . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie 
as we consider the motion , we need also to consider what is in place under the Canada Labour Code , especially under part II of the code , because it is part II of the code which governs occupational safety and health for employees working in organizations under federal jurisdiction . 
i declare Motion No. 391 lost . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :

Mr. Janko Peric

madam Speaker , the changes the government has introduced to the AIDA program will benefit many producers across the country . 
in January the Canadian millennium scholarship fund will begin to generate over 10,000 scholarships .

Mr. Speaker , because it is true .

in order to avoid distortions and waste , the Government of Quebec therefore asked the federal government to comply with the Emploment Insurance Act , which calls for the right to opt out with full compensation . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
i think that the hon. member , who is the chair of the Standing Committee on Health and who is said to be a strong supporter of the Minister of Health for future events , will join me in asking his government to exert pressure and to make money available in the Minister of Finance ' s budget , so that the provinces can meet the needs of all their clienteles , including the veterans .

i have no doubt that we will continue to prove ourselves to be so in the future , but the will and the spirit to co - operate has to be there . 
i do not see a quorum . 
for a variety of reasons . 
we have to work not only at dealing with an interim crisis but at a long term and strategic solution for it . 
in 1860 , it was adopted as our national emblem on the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales to Toronto . 
i would like my colleague ' s comment on that . 
we have a concern that the government is collecting taxes when it should not be . 
hon. Jane Stewart 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin by announcing that I will be splitting my 20 minutes with the hon. member for Vancouver East .

you may speak on the amendment . 
it is another report that has simply been shelved or put away to gather dust for another day . 
when you ask for consent , Mr. Speaker , are members allowed to yell no from a standing position behind the curtain ? 
there will be ample opportunity for all members of the committee and , by virtue of their membership , members of their parties and Canadians whom they represent to make amendments and suggestions as to how the bill might be improved . 
we must keep up with our competitors .

that process needs to be expedited . 
the Government will enter into a national accord with the voluntary sector , laying a new foundation for active partnership with voluntary organizations in the service of Canadians . 
i said earlier that I thought this initiative deserved our enthusiastic support . 
the political rewards cannot be seen by the same generation but perhaps can be harvested by the next one .

what is the rush ? 
i would appeal to his historic memory . 
they do not want the stigma to continue that maritimers are dependent on the rest of the country and have to leave to get jobs .

marine Liability Bill 
however , if we give an airline a chance to rationalize some of that capacity , instead of 12 flights a day into certain centres by Air Canada and 12 by Canadian Airlines almost at the same time maybe we would end up with 8 in those centres but we would have service to other areas on a much more frequent basis . 
Mr. Speaker , the more we question the government about its clarity bill , the more its answers are evasive and confusing . 
i am not a square head as the member seems to indicate . 
that is to say , it had no instrument or route map to follow , had the result of the 1995 referendum gone the other way .

it underscores the importance for every member of the House to try to do everything humanly possible not to inflame the tension that has gripped communities in the east coast fisheries . 
we are still far from a decent minimum , but the added disposable income will help people on modest incomes meet their basic needs . 
Mr. Speaker , I listened carefully to the speech made by my hon. colleague from the NDP , who made a sad assessment of the current Liberal government ' s record . 
i agree with the principle of the bill , but it needs a lot of changes . 
hon. Don Boudria 
obviously , our caucus , through our health critic , the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest , will certainly make extremely efficient efforts to put forward amendments concerning the administrative structure . 
it was written by Yvonne Roberts and it was called " Northern rights . "

to my way of thinking , they are the victims of the lack of vision of the federal government , whose economic strategy for this region hinged solely on the mining industry . 
we have had a debate recently on this issue and I think it is important to put it into context . 
first , I am informed that the man who has driven so far in his combine to be here in Ottawa and express his views to government at the highest levels , was received by the Prime Minister last evening . 
these agreements were signed . 
the government wishes to remind us that we all have a role to play in reaching this goal , and we will all benefit from these efforts . 
we should be proud that this treaty finally sets out the rights of the Nisga ' a people . 
as such , we cannot get any response from one of our members . 
the Speaker : 
i can only assure her that the minister is very involved and continues to move the agenda forward . 
Mr. Peter MacKay :

my question is for the Minister of International Trade . 
can the minister explain where the incentive is in sucking 49 % out of a so - called incentive bonus ? 
the Speaker : 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
its multidisciplinary research program could concern the problems caused by the ageing of Canadians . 
marine Liability Bill 
Mr. Bob Speller ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
that is not the hon. member ' s real point . 
i am asking for the co - operation of the House as a whole to pass this bill so that it can be implemented as soon as possible . 
they are having to satisfy themselves with what is in this treaty , and the Liberals are in a conspiracy with other parties in the House to force the treaty on the Nisga ' a people . 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , when we brought to the attention of the government the serious allegations of electoral wrongdoing by the international trade minister , the government House leader urged me to bring these allegations to the attention of the commissioner of Elections Canada , and I have done so . 
in the wake of the 1995 referendum , the Prime Minister presented his motion on distinct society and said that he would take this notion into account when bills were passed . 
when greener pastures are only across the 49 th parallel , where tax freedom day comes in May instead of July , I do not think we can blame people for leaving . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
what it talks about are administrative challenges in the department ' s paperwork . 
it was the Canadian Population Health Initiative . 
NISGA ' A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
among changes for the future that I would like my colleagues in the party opposite to address would be whether a contribution could be made by creating specialized tribunals of first instance . 
there is also a message for all Quebec federalists in this speech : this is the end of renewed federalism , of Quebec ' s traditional demands , this is the end of the concept of founding people , of distinct character , all those formulas that were found in an attempt to renew Canadian federalism . 
it was because of the exclusion of the public in the debate and in the negotiations and of having those negotiations behind closed doors that the uncertainty is there whether they like it or not . 
the next question is on Motion No. 262 . 
my question to the minister is very simple . 
motion as modified agreed to . 
we always have to exercise caution in the approval of any drug , but we are talking about a drug that was approved in 40 other jurisdictions . 
the Government of Canada feels that these export subsidies that are being brought on by both the Americans and the Europeans are bad for the Canadian economy and are hurting Canadian farmers .

however , if Erik were to have the gumption and the wherewithal to be self - employed , to own his own company or to have some sort of independent contracting relationship set up with any other employer , he would then be docked and the campaign would be hit financially in terms of its aggregate spending limit by his involvement in the campaign . 
we are not talking about any form of revised welfare . 
we should rededicate ourselves to Canada .

Mrs. Michelle Dockrill 
parliament was disappearing simply because of the strains on executive government . 
we should learn from the past and not necessarily revisit it , other than to learn from it . 
i did want to respond to a couple of the comments that I have heard from the Liberal Party in particular regarding the Nisga ' a final agreement .

Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) : 
members 
one thinks of the metaphor of a deer caught in the headlights . 
the next question is on Motion No. 170 . 
Mr. Grant McNally 
they photocopied them and made copies available to us . 
honourable senators , I raised a point of order relating to the substance of Senator Fraser ' s notice of motion . 
they do indeed need reform . 
there are other legislative vehicles at both levels of jurisdiction that are appropriate for lesser offences . 
Canadians support the investment that the federal government has made in research , education and funding of the health care system . 
if the hon. member for Wentworth - Burlington is asking for the unanimous consent of the House to extend for two or three minutes , I think we have already crossed that bridge . 
honourable senators , if I may add a few comments and perhaps reassure the Honourable Senator Lynch - Staunton , when we considered this motion , it involved having quite a broad mandate to enable us to examine all issues relative to fisheries . 
Mr. Speaker , let us be very clear for the Reform Party . 
as usual , the interests of farmers are being subordinated to those of the grain companies and the railways . 
Mr. Randy White : 
the changes made by your committee to Bill C - 7 have ensured a clear , narrow and limited exception to the Criminal Records Act . 
i sit on the subcommittee on Private Members ' Business . 
i recall making speeches not unlike this one in 1987 - 88 when we were debating the free trade agreement , then NAFTA , then the institution of the WTO and the MAI . 
Mr. Marcel Proulx 
also the legislation gives cause to look at another situation which is in direct conflict with the alleged intent of Bill C - 10 . 
every Canadian knows it is the same old Reform underneath , no matter how many times they change their name . 
it is just really shocking . 
it is an article from La Presse that clearly indicates to what extent - 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
would the Leader of the Government in the Senate also seek advice from the Attorney General of Canada as to whether , in extremis , which many of us consider this situation to be , the disallowance power would be adopted for legislation we feel is inconsistent with the 21 st century and Canada ? 
time and time again statistics show that all social indicators on Indian reserves are much worse than for the general population . 
it is up to the committee to decide how it should proceed , and the witnesses must abide by any decision the committee makes . 
motion No. 21 
we benefited a great deal from their advice . 
Mr. David Price 
now the Department of Transport will take all that information into account before it makes a final decision on whether all the laws are being properly respected to ensure that the public interest is fully protected . 
Mr. Speaker , the members of the Conservative Party vote yes on this motion . 
returning officers are the guardians of the democratic process society prides itself on . 
to maximize their efficiency , criminal organizations impose the law of silence , and any transgression means death , immediately and unconditionally , for the informers . 
he can completely ignore any decision of the panel if it suits his purpose and his decision is absolutely final . 
that is what I hope to focus on , that we begin a process , a comprehensive plan of progress with all those parties that are affected by the fisheries issues , to bring them together and talk about real solutions . 
this idea , however , is not new for us . 
i hope the minister noticed that we have a legislation in Quebec . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
senator Stratton : 
all the way through it , it says that relationships must be conjugal . 
the Quebec National Assembly can pass whatever resolution it wants , but I repeat today that , if the question on secession is not clear and if there is not a clear majority , there will be no negotiation . 
that is exactly what we are doing . 
i am transparently aware that the only thing the interprovincial affairs and justice ministers have done is to have a reference of three questions to the supreme court and a letter writing exercise between the federal interprovincial affairs minister and the interprovincial affairs minister of the Quebec government . 
i am glad to say that I do not have that background and I never will . 
it might be a short way to seeing the solution we desire , but there are other means at our disposal which could be as effective . 
i stood up when I realized this and the Clerk turned his head . 
Mr. Speaker , I will repeat . 
human RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
the order is dropped from the order paper . 
we somehow doubt it , but we hope that will be the case .

hon. Donald H . Oliver :

Mr. Speaker , today marks the beginning of Veterans Week , a week when we remember the sacrifices of all those who served for Canada .

we know that we cannot have justice in a day or a matter of weeks unless we have adjudicators of a commandant form and we are not going to have them .

i had an idea for some time to convene the Speakers from wherever they were across Canada just to bring us together to share an evening . 
i would like to have Senator Fraser ' s comments because I know that they will be well thought out . 
senator St. Germain : 
hon. David Anderson 
the clearest example of this is the referendum on the Charlottetown accord where the yes side in that debate spent over $ 20 million . 
Mrs. Marois was one of them . 
before the European settlers arrived , the Nisga ' a were a community of 30,000 people . 
it deals with the calling of the byelections but fails to deal with holding the byelections and when exactly that is going to happen . 
when we had a majority in opposition , we resisted many times - with difficulty , I admit - the urge to obstruct for the sake of obstruction , which was the case during much of the 1980 s and in 1990 when the roles were reversed . 
even while she kept repeating that , she had an urgent e - mail and fax on her desk that said the complete opposite . 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C - 11 , a very important and timely bill not only for the island of Cape Breton but for all Nova Scotia and the east coast . 
it is a bit like trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube . 
the Conservatives are very embarrassed , because they have no position on this issue . 
by creating these 1,200 chairs of research excellence , and hopefully bringing them up to 2,000 , we will be able to keep our proven star researchers and attract the rising stars . 
i thought the permanent financing would come to an end at some point . 
in Quebec , the right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms that was proclaimed in 1975 . 
equally important , it risks making the courts the arbiters of social policy . 
Mr. Speaker , I said that this is an audit by the department . 
indeed , the Prime Minister indicated last evening in a public interview , which I had the opportunity to see , that some action with respect to the federal government ' s view on the issue of clarity might be done any number of ways . 
only 5,000 are known to have left the country and 13,000 were actually accepted as refugees .

Mr. Speaker , as I indicated previously , when the director of CSIS informed me of this very serious matter he indicated to me that the inspector general was investigating the issue . 
in most places in Canada it is against the law to operate a motor vehicle without wearing a seat belt . 
honourable senators , I would mention that a number of members of the committee , including myself , pointed out to the minister that even if clause 8 of Bill C - 69 , which refers to regulatory powers , indicated that the offences selected for inclusion in the list would be of a sexual nature , the bill did not indicate it applied only those individuals who had been sentenced for a sexual offence . 
in M. v H . it was recognized that one lesbian partner had financial responsibilities to her former partner which flowed from that relationship . 
the Speaker : 
that is a great deal of money for debt servicing . 
when that term is raised to 50 years , I am convinced , based on judgments such as Warden of Mountain Institution v. Theodore Steele and R . v. Lyons , that the Supreme Court would rule that Bill C - 247 is contrary to the cruel and unusual punishment provision in section 12 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and , therefore , unconstitutional . 
we strongly support the increases in the federal political contribution tax credit limits for individuals . 
the minister and his department obviously refuse to go down there on a long term basis to deal with the issue . 
i can detail , for example , that in the 1997 campaign , 33 % of the total of the personal and business donations to the Prime Minister ' s personal campaign had some government grant or government loan association to it . 
he wants tax relief now .

Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :

would there not be a hue and cry for something to be done ?

in 1999 - 2000 , all indications point again to overspending and a budget plan that already has in it fat , questionable categories .

that is one of the reasons the economy is now booming in the U.S. , while many hundreds of thousands of Canadians are still out of work .

the principal points in the opinion were as follows : neither international nor Canadian law gives Quebec the right to secede unilaterally . 
the difference this time is that there appears to be little doubt , in fact absolutely no doubt , as to the source of the violation of the privileges of the members of the House . 
deputy Speaker : 
i am thinking in particular of the Canadian institutes of health research mentioned in the budget , and of the announcement made yesterday by the Prime Minister concerning university chairs . 
we hope that your week with us will be interesting and instructive . 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
clearly , as we have realized with the bill on clarity , the government is pushing us for time . 
it seems that every time I go to the Minister of Health ' s office , I either get lip service or really nothing much at all in terms of assistance . 
i think this is an interesting idea . 
i would urge hon. members to refrain from mentioning one another by name and stick with the constituency name or title as required under the rules . 
it is unbelievable that the United States has such an overcapacity of work that it has to get Canadian workers , who are the best in the world when it comes to building ships , to build ships in the United States . 
No. 
motion No. 62 
it is not that we want to do it in a hasty fashion because no one wants to see that happen . 
planes were grounded , boats were docked , investigations were shelved due to lack of resources . 
senator Kirby : 
in the middle of the game , he suddenly says " Oh , by the way , there has been a rule change and here is where we stand on it '' . 
the analogy had nothing to do with the situation that was occurring in the United Kingdom with respect to the Chancellor or the Exchequer or the Lord High Chancellor . 
Mr. Speaker , Canadian farmers ' worst fears were realized at the WTO talks in Seattle .

amendment to the amendment negatived 
it is always the same thing with the government across the way . 
we should be prepared to respond with food and other supplies to emergencies around the world , instead of making people wait days and days for help . 
why will the Prime Minister not abandon his $ 47 billion spending - 
Cape Breton is a perfect example . 
they included employer groups , unions and labour organizations , academics , provincial governments , territories , and other interested parties . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 211 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
the Nisga ' a treaty also takes into account Nisga ' a people living off Nisga ' a lands . 
hon. Senators : 
government ORDERS 
honourable senators , I am also pleased that there is now a response on the farm crisis from the federal government . 
what the honourable senator is saying is that after second reading he intends to move a motion to that effect ? 
it will benefit many people in this country . 
do members think that this began with a dialogue and that the provinces were involved in these macroeconomic decisions ? 
in that regard , there can be no doubt that responsibility for compensating hepatitis C victims who were infected before 1986 and after 1990 rests squarely with the government . 
let me remind hon. members that because of the firearms registration system , we have - 
the Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to give the Royal Assent to the said bill . 
i have two more which I did not read into the record . 
order , please . 
a negative vote on Motion No. 68 requires that the question be put on Motion No. 69 . 
it is my belief that , with the young offenders legislation , or the amendments the Minister of Justice wants to make to the Young Offenders Act , these young people will be marked forever , branded , considering all the publicity that surrounds this issue . 
in small towns across Canada there are concerns about organized crime . 
i will move to the second aspect of Bill C - 23 which warrants examination and substantial reworking . 
statistics in Quebec demonstrate just how right my colleague from Berthier - Montcalm was . 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale 
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) : 
it is , however , important that we recognize that the court has attempted in this advisory opinion to use that technique of " reading in " to legislation that which is not contained therein . 
they have a majority and can do whatever they want . 
leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions : 
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) : 
in other words , if the representative of the Queen cannot , for one reason or another , play an active and regular role in the legislative process , why should this duty fall to someone else ? 
they also made suggestions . 
the youth criminal justice act will establish a more efficient process . 
i was trained that way . 
the government said that the courts are criticizing members of parliament for speaking up and criticizing some court decisions . 
it specifically concerns the treaty and bodes ill for the future . 
this bill does not meet the expectations of those who wish for privacy . 
other provinces have determined that they neither have the resources nor the inclination to create their own provincial privacy protection legislation and prefer that this be included under the broad federal legislation . 
i must interrupt the hon. member . 
procedure and House Affairs 
the Speaker : 
we regret that the NDP cannot support Bill C - 8 in its present form . 
bill C - 247 advances the position that all those changes have been insufficient and that more are required . 
i have been waiting now for weeks to ask that leader to give me some assurance that he will tell us before the debate is over , if his party were ever to form the government , what it would do relating to aboriginal rights and the kinds of agreements we need to sign for reconciliation of our historic differences . 
i ' ve talked with the victims ' parents . 
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) : 
health CARE 
madam Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to speak in the House on the motion presented by the official opposition which holds in question the department of human resources and the minister . 
this petition contains 34 names , mostly from the town of Cardston . 
bill C - 20 
i declare Motion No. 79 lost . 
not only will those people stay in Canada to earn their living , but some medical advances will probably be brought to this country because of them . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
the point I wish to make is that this circumstance is unusual . 
let me reiterate that Bill C - 10 strengthens the fairness , equity and predictability of federal payments in lieu of taxes .

members 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne ( Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert , BQ ) : 
even you , Madam Speaker , somewhat wished it deep down inside . 
we are still asking the government for its partnership and effort to develop the drugs we need . 
the hon. member has even referred to this himself . 
No. 
some hon. members : 
they are not democrats , because if they were , they would recognize the integrity , the legitimacy and the validity of the referendum process . 
normally , the question concerning the business of the House is asked on Thursday . 
i found this most disconcerting because any users that wanted to have that old growth experience only had to go there instead of where they were .

senator Angus : 
we must also ensure the long term viability of rural Canada and rural Canadians . 
there are three government agencies , the Royal Canadian Mint , Canada Post and CMHC , that hold property in local communities . 
the federal Export and Import of Hazardous Wastes Regulations , pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , provide for strict controls for any import of hazardous wastes into Canada , including a notification requirement . 
by the way , the Nisga ' a land claim area is in his riding . 
the question is not an easy one . 
most recently , the present government has been in the debacle of definitions concerning pay equity . 
the member says " free enterprise '' . 
Mr. Norman Doyle 
the way it works is there are 40 minute slots for the first round of debate if we are resuming debate for the first three speakers . 
the pay levels of chiefs and councils are incredible , given the horrific economic conditions and unemployment rates which exist on many reserves . 
at the same time , the people of Saint - Maurice are very happy with their member of parliament . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
this is part of the prioritization of spending . 
Mr. Bill Graham 
what protection is being given to discount airlines against this giant monopoly that we will have ? 
what a concept . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , we on this side agree to the proposition that Senator Lynch - Staunton ' s motion retain its standing on the Order Paper , even though he will not speak to it today . 
indeed , last Friday , when 1.30 p.m. came around , you told me I still had 25 minutes and 54 seconds . 
in fact this government has done a number of things which I would share with the House from a crime fighting standpoint . 
yes , but it was conditional ! 
then , we moved it on to the next stage . 
they had been dutifully planning , working hard on behalf of the residents of their cities , all for naught because the Conservative Government of Canada froze their grants overnight without telling them anything about it . 
gas stations in Abitibi have nothing to do with this situation . 
instead of even considering compromise and agreement , the minister seems intent on maintaining the 50 candidate rule . 
i did not think when I came to this House that I would have to fight against enemies of democracy ; enemies of Quebec ' s democracy , a democracy which was built and is still based on a parliament , a national assembly we are very proud of .

they will never be able to make money in that pit .

Mr. Lou Sekora 
2 nd Session , 36 th Parliament , 
it is time to start looking at a community based strategy so that all people , aboriginal and non - aboriginal , can work together for the long term benefit of this resource . 
it is unfortunate that the citizenship legislation came before the House before those major changes were made to the Immigration Act . 
i declare Motion No. 148 lost . 
since the commission was established , Canada has steadily moved up in the global rankings as a tourism destination , and now ranks eight . 
but who can be surprised ? 
it is a social concept that they do not accept . 
my task today is to deal with the big picture which I will now proceed to do . 
the arguments being used by my colleague for Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan are exactly the opposite of the laudable objectives he wants to pursue . 
as many of us know , effectively raising children requires a sustained expenditure of resources . 
also , we now have a committee of appeal . 
* * * 
decorum 
if that does not beat all . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order to suggest to the hon. member opposite that I stood to say I was withholding unanimous consent . 
there are a lot of issues to be discussed and I appreciate the hon. member ' s question . 
why is it that the government House leader is so concerned that the Communist Party of Canada or the Green Party of Canada might actually have its party name on the ballot ? 
according to the same source , it would appear that economic crimes cost the people of Quebec and of Canada a minimum of $ 5 billion annually . 
the letter was from the president to the minister and it said : " The simple fact is that InterCanadian simply cannot continue to withstand the continuously changing position of the government '' . 
does the hon. member have permission to split his time ? 
Mrs. Karen Redman 
motion for Address in Reply - Debate Continued

hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
why is the government playing Scrooge in this the Christmas season ? 
two other honourable provincial speakers were here yesterday . 
members 
i am absolutely convinced that it is these programs that have helped men and women in my riding find opportunities that otherwise would not have been there . 
Mr. Speaker , more to the point , why is the deputy minister not supporting the provincial Liberals in British Columbia ? 
i also know that with your cooperation we will work in the best interests of the Senate .

on what basis ? 
does he realize that a minority could impose its will on the majority ?

Mr. Paul Cr ê te : 
that is what governments are supposed to do ; that is their job . 
every Canadian deserves the right to be treated fairly . 
Mr. Jim Abbott 
congratulations to all concerned . 
they do not have the money and are having trouble maintaining services . 
the bill was first introduced in 1996 and reintroduced in 1997 . 
in evaluating measures to be taken , and before deciding on further action , Canada takes care to " do no harm " to those who are suffering abuses and whom we are trying to help . 
will the minister lend her support to a parliamentary committee study which would examine all government departments and agencies and how they recover costs ?

quick legislation is bad legislation . 
then there were the three famous decisions we often read about in the newspapers : 
that Bill C - 2 , in Clause 407 , be amended by replacing line 35 on page 166 with the following : 
the Deputy Speaker : 
some of the lands will transfer fee simple to individuals . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
they responded with the Durham report , which said that the people of Quebec , the people of Lower Canada , were a people with no history and no culture .

you are lucky that I am no longer allowed to give passionate speeches , as I used to do . 
Canadians need to be brought into the discussion and included in an examination of this issue . 
the Minister shall make available to the public any advice received from the advisory panel . " 
we would suggest that the foreign content limit be increased to 50 % immediately , and ultimately be eliminated once we have had an opportunity to evaluate the impact of it . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt 
however , we have seen just as consistently that it has not paid off .

Mr. Philip Mayfield 
the other thing that my colleague from Sydney - Victoria raised is the RCMP ' s inability to enforce the laws and put an end to some of the terrible organized crime we have in the country .

it isn ' t worth the trouble '' . 
maybe we will have another day like that . 
bill C - 258 . 
on the next page , there is another statement by Senator Angus while raising a supplementary question : 
it was interesting that , after 15 years , Clifford Olson was able to get a member of the staff at the penitentiary to actually talk about what a good guy he really was and to say how he did not fear for his safety . 
that brings me to today ' s debate . 
first Report of Special Committee Tabled 
" 20.1 ( 1 ) On the expiration of three years after the coming into force of this Act , the provisions contained herein shall be referred to such committee of the House of Commons , as may be designated or established for that purpose . 
that is discrimination . 
there we borrowed two horses and a tent from a longtime rancher in the Milk River area , Tom Gilchrist . 
statistics Canada ' s most recent numbers indicate that illiteracy continues to be a major problem for many Canadians . 
is there unanimous consent ? 
the approach in this legislation is more restrictive , permitting disclosure but not removing it from the ambit of the legislation . 
Mr. Speaker , that is a very good question . 
i would also like to express appreciation to the Right Honourable Romeo LeBlanc and Mrs. Fowler LeBlanc . 
that has been long overdue . 
his father was a member of the provincial government for over 23 years , the provincial government that Premier Mike Harris currently leads . 
i support this bill , not because it is perfect , but because it moves in the right direction . 
they should go ahead and adjust accordingly . 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
Canadians want tax cuts , but not just any kind of tax cuts . 
in fact , we are happy that Mr. Weekes has taken a contract with another company , which has no relations with the Government of Canada or that office .

members 
the member for Wetaskiwin knows full well that we do not to refer to the absence or the presence of members in the House either collectively or individually . 
it maintained the system of band councils and gave the problem itself second wind .

currently over 60 % of our GDP and 12 % of our exports are in the service sector and service exports are growing at a rate of over 9 % per year . 
agreed . 
the Liberals would have the public believe that Reform has not dealt with or had discussions with the public , stakeholders or the Nisga ' a . 
that Bill C - 6 be amended by deleting Clause 4.5 of Schedule 1 . 
can the minister confirm whether or not members of her political staff in her office have contacted the police forces involved in the investigations on a production company from Montreal ? 
this is a slight diversion from the topic but it has to do with the mathematics involved . 
later he said : 
the biggest single difference between Canadian rules in elections and U.S. rules in elections is the fact that we have reasonable campaign spending limits in Canada . 
i should not say they were all rejected , because in the brilliance of the Liberal government , I know of two farmers who received aid under the AIDA program .

hon. Lorne Nystrom 
will the federal government admit that it has improved its finances at the expense of the provincial budgets and that transfer payments must be restored to their previous levels in order to allow the provinces to reinvest in health and education ? 
i declare Motion No. 143 lost . 
this is certainly not a question of privilege , as I said , and I hope that in such debates the members will chose their words very carefully .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
hear , hear . 
members 
i think this is an argument that clearly shows that Public Works and Government Services has done something right . 
Mr. Speaker , this issue is really of critical importance everywhere in rural and urban Manitoba and Saskatchewan . It is sufficiently important that two agriculture ministers were here last week to meet with the minister . 
that opinion was expressed by a constitutional lawyer , Gerald Chipeur , before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs . 
we must require greater public disclosure and enhance every consumer ' s right to know . 
to facilitate the transition from the Medical Research Council to the institutes , an interim governing council was appointed made up of 34 eminent Canadians representing the research community , health practitioners , the private sector , charities , university presidents , granting councils and provinces . 
as such , I had the opportunity to submit a brief from our association to a parliamentary committee of the National Assembly on the subject of the establishment of a law to protect personal information in private enterprise , a Quebec law .

how can government members and this minister sit there with smirks on their faces and say that there is general consensus that this agreement does not change the Constitution of Canada ?

given the importance of this bill to democracy in Quebec , will the Prime Minister promise to set up a travelling committee so that Quebecers ' views on Bill C - 20 can be heard ? 
i must give accolades to those people , for example , Dr. Barr at University Hospital in London , Ontario , and those men and women who looked after my mother and made it possible for her to continue , as so many hundreds and thousands of people work very hard to do . 
in effect this motion is asking the Liberal government to uphold the law . 
Mr. Philip Mayfield 
Mr. Speaker , I would point out to the hon. member that last year , and even this year , the leaders of each province and territory met regarding this problem . 
Mr. Irwin Cotler , for the electoral district of Mount Royal 
sexual covers it all but conjugal actually refers specifically to a heterosexual relationship . 
for example , during the referendum on the Charlottetown accord , the yes side lost even though it spent at least 10 times as much as the no side . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
we all have heard in the past few weeks how the government and the banks are mishandling this program . 
it has been spiteful to the people of Canada by giving them a sense that we will finally settle the issue and we will not .

we will oppose the bill because it will make the commission a crown corporation . 
this document is entitled " A separated Quebec has the moral and legal right to use the Canadian dollar '' . 
this government , however , has just found another argument for waiting rather than acting and taking decisions . 
Mr. Daniel Turp 
we need to figure out how they can enhance each other , how they can be made more efficient and how they can operate on a continental basis rather than on a country basis . 
however , let me offer the cautious observation that I do not think that the Senate has ever had any power to influence , ahead of time , a decision about whether or not a government would enter into constitutional negotiation . 
Mr. Speaker , if the House would agree , I would propose that you seek unanimous consent that members who voted on the previous motion be recorded as having voted on the motion now before the House with Liberal members voting yea .

Dr. Birgeneau is a Toronto native and a citizen of Canada . 
most provinces do not have residential treatment facilities .

the spectacular flip - flops of Liberal cabinet ministers and backbenchers now that they are in power cries out for consistent legislation and specific direction for our courts . 
are we to understand - and that is what we would like Canadians to realize - that the government is trying to do something that will certainly gag the opposition ? 
if we end up having to define the resources we are going to have to give the native fishers , we will need to know where those resources are coming from .

there is a growing consensus among Saskatchewan farmers that they would best be served by the minister if he followed his own advice and resigned today . 
it is important that Canada ' s First Nations have an unencumbered land base . 
his amendment deals with electronic voting .

a few rules and parameters have already been set down which we have to abide by . 
Mr. John Bryden : 
agreed . 
perhaps I will rely on the opinion of others in this chamber . 
for what ? 
he was the same in politics , firing shots that would land just inside the line . 
human rights are much more than treasures exhibited in a showcase ; they are the very essence of an individual ' s quality of life . 
the establishment of an International Criminal Tribunal is only one of the many current initiatives taken by Canada and the international community to deal with these problems .

we were also told of a certain reluctance at DIAND among bureaucrats to actually negotiate self - government . 
the government ' s response was to expedite the process . 
some hon. members : 
i am still quoting the recommendation . 
i remind the House that it was this government in 1993 that adopted the the proposal of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities which was wandering in the wilderness when the Tories were in power .

moreover , this bill is legally flawed . 
we must set ambitious , concrete objectives , and work with Canadians to achieve them . 
here we are and we cannot subsidize our shipyards . 
these sessions met the government ' s objectives to build constructive links to and promote a dialogue with representatives of civil society on trade and investment related issues across Canada ; to bring to the discussions a broad spectrum of stakeholders representing environmental , human rights and labour interests , as well as members of the business community ; and to advance further substantive discussions with these stakeholders to ensure that Canadians ' priorities and interests on these issues are reflected in the new round of WTO negotiations .

now we have permitted him to have four reports a year so that he can find out where the problems are and we can rectify them .

maybe a starting point would be a comparison with the airline industry in Australia . 
i have been there about 13 times now . 
it is unfortunate that he is obliged to read from texts that clearly are written by his leader , because he could not defend such an argument in any international forum on the decentralization of federations in the world . 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier 
just do not ask for recognition or acknowledgement of what you are . 
i wish to make certain that I am understood by another fine gentlemen whom I know very well , one I supported as secretary of the Liberal Party in the 1970 s . 
hon. Lyle Vanclief : 
what has she done about this since she became minister of HRDC ? 
senator Boudreau : 
but instead , the government is driven by a desire to be more involved , to have more control , to have its own legislation , always for noble reasons , such as the fact that no such legislation exists outside Quebec . 
Canadians will not be fooled . 
that having been said , I now learn that the debate will be adjourned after my remarks . 
Mr. John Williams : 
the issue of what constitutes commercial activity is not clearly defined . 
Mr. Rick Laliberte

we have important issues to deal with . 
the first example refers to the form of government established for Nisga ' a people under the agreement . 
when there is troop movement from base Gagetown - the largest Canadian Forces Base not only in Canada but also , in terms of geography , in the British Commonwealth - they must bus in from Moncton , which has a longer runway so that it can handle the Armed Forces Airbuses . 
i look forward to the bill coming before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs , where we can look at it to ensure that it does what it is duly intended to do , which is very important . 
in this case , 45 witnesses will appear before the committee . 
the ECONOMY 
it puts an undue burden on the very low income families where much of the youth crime and violence actually occurs . 
it must support the Conseil pour le libre - é change pour le bois d ' oeuvre and demand the restoration of free trade for lumber . 
things are apparently going to be very emotional today . 
i think it is a bargain , quite frankly . 
i declare Motion No. 21 lost . 
on motion of Senator Hays , debate adjourned . 
on division . 
Mr. Scott Brison 
the Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , on September 15 the coast guard vessel Bernier was removed from active search and rescue duty on Canada ' s east coast so that a lavish dinner party and cruise could be held for 30 senior bureaucrats of Correctional Service Canada . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 430 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
some hon. members : 
my constituents are also concerned about defence spending and the government ' s lack of effectively investing in the defence of our country and in our national defence system . 
we could talk about the billion dollar boondoggle in aboriginal affairs , and I suppose there are other areas . 
while that money may have been necessary , these bonuses and rewards were paid out on the backs of privates and corporals . 
when considering this point of order , Mr. Speaker , you must understand that we will stand up for the equal rights of all Canadians , including the Nisga ' a . 
is this a system that is going to solve aboriginal problems ? 
in correspondence with the Prime Minister , Mr. Campbell said he found the limited hearing process in B.C. and the skewing of witnesses unacceptable . 
their contributions to maintaining peace in the world are even more significant in light of the hardships and resource limitations that they must endure , not the least of which are those imposed upon them by their own government . 
this is not a new concept . 
we now have negative figures in Saskatchewan and in Manitoba for farm income . 
nays 
that means that small towns across the prairies are in trouble and that businesses and farms which families built up over two and three generations are likely to disappear . 
in 1995 , the Hon. Ronald A . Irwin published a guide entitled " The Government of Canada ' s Approach to Implementation of the Inherent Right and the Negotiation of Aboriginal Self - Government '' . 
i have a minor question , and not a question of policy . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
agreed . 
this is a ridiculous state of affairs . 
he went on to praise Canada as a pathfinder nation in the creation of a better world , adding that the " Canadian ethic " enjoyed profound respect in his country . 
he committed the same error of not making a stand and he did not propose a solid , logical and rational framework . 
on page 1 , subsection 17 ( 1 ) of the original act states : 
the bill is entitled the modernization of benefits and obligations . 
once again , they have ignored the problem caused by orphan clauses . 
those processes would be replaced with an open , transparent negotiating process in which all interests are appropriately represented and which Indian affairs is not put in a conflict of interest situation . 
the present Minister of Human Resources Development , in that portfolio only since the summer of 1999 , has some responsibility because she learned of the situation as early as last fall but waited until January to make it public , while parliament was not sitting , so as to keep things as quiet as possible . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
however , there are ways to get around that . 
not one single solitary statement was made in the Speech from the Throne dealing with this particular issue . 
nays 
three other parties in the opposition agree that this debate has to be concluded in the proper fashion so we can do justice to the obligations we have vis - à - vis the Nisga ' a nation . 
madam Speaker , I have the honour to present the 17 th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the membership of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans . 
no one knows that . 
we as the opposition have every responsibility to bring that to the attention of others in the country . 
i would not be surprised that in aid of improving it and streamlining it there will be some other changes . 
other people have spoken very eloquently in the House about Mr. Webb and his background . 
that is policy set in place to help those who need that leg up in society . 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :

Mr. Preston Manning 
such measures would not deal with the root of the problem , which is the international trade in people smuggling . 
youth who commit criminal acts must understand what they have done to someone else ' s life , how they have violated the person ' s rights , and the measure of stress and distress they have wrought for their victim and their victim ' s family . 
as members of the House are representatives of the people , the people should have a role to play , an understanding and a vote on what takes place in this competitive merger .

a Canadian company was the lead winner on the bid . 
i stress once again that if the committee were allowed to travel as the Bloc is proposing , if it were allowed to go to different parts of the country , we would get a different view from Canadians of what they would like to see the government show in the area of leadership when it comes to national unity . 
we will build on a pilot project now under way to make www . access . ca 
there are prospects for tomorrow in terms of stability in our agriculture and opportunities in world trade . 
actually the members opposite should not talk about things . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
i declare Motion No. 420 lost . 
by developing best practices through a co - operative process involving municipal and federal stakeholders the government will ensure consistency in the treatment of these properties across Canada . 
one of them is the wearing of jackets . 
so I voted in favour . 
i am told that the program is working well . 
i do not know which treaty the members opposite are debating . 
we should not say whether one member is here or not on any given day . 
nays 
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Pierrefonds - Dollard , Lib . ) : 
the government has always had a bottomless purse to pursue pork barrel projects in the Prime Minister ' s riding , development aid to despotic countries like China and useless initiatives such as universal firearms registration . 
they knew that the meeting was taking place . 
worse still , on October 12 a bolt popped off a Sea King , forcing an emergency landing at Shearwater . 
to his credit the Prime Minister did intervene and he did prevent what could have been a disastrous situation for our defence and aerospace industries . 
officials have refused 587 new applications for public safety reasons and have revoked 504 licences to individuals who no longer meet the eligibility requirements . 
it gives the impression of warm and fuzzy . 
what about the mess within the National Parole Board , whose board members themselves , duly appointed by this government , are telling us that a major cleanup is needed ? 
intentions were clear , the yoke of economic dependence had to be broken , and we had to fly with our own wings within a prosperous Canada . 
i do not think casting aspersions on the motives of other political parties is something that is particularly untoward in our system of government . 
practically nothing had changed . 
i regularly have to show proof of age at clubs , but nevertheless , I am 37 . 
my hon. colleague , the member for Palliser , says that Canada certainly has the financial resources to compete on a comparative basis with the United States and Europe . 
motion No. 36 negatived 
tribute 
honourable senators , as I indicated at second reading , as a general comment , this is a bill that enjoys and deserves to enjoy just about universal support from Parliament , as well as to the extent that there is any awareness of it out there in the country . 
the hon. member mentioned certain things in his speech that I think refer directly to the efforts you have made toward tourism and the establishment of industries in Canada and in particular , a certain establishment that has some taste , that makes some bread , and which has brought together some cultures in Edmonton . 
the Speaker : 
Ms. Alexa McDonough 
the government cannot deny responsibility for the situation , and it contributes to maintaining the farm income crisis . 
that this House strike a special parliamentary committee with the specific objective of considering the repercussions of the globalization of economies on governments ' autonomy in preserving social cohesiveness . 
as we enter the next century the Canadian forces will continue to play a vital role as an instrument of our resolve , the resolve of Canadians and of our values . 
there is no recognition of that in this agreement whatever . 
because we recognize that until people become citizens of our country , we do not allow them to vote for the governments . 
honourable senators , I should like to share with you today my reactions to the Speech from the Throne opening the Second Session of the Thirty - sixth Parliament of Canada . 
this means that native fishers will once again take to the waters without any government restrictions . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
as the Leader of the Government knows , fisheries is a major resource which is still extremely important to the people of Atlantic Canada . 
these messages have been repeated over and over until the people have begun to believe them . 
* * * 
there is no point in our minister touring the globe and meeting with cultural policymakers unless there is an upfront commitment from Canada that we want culture to be really removed from the WTO and all regional trade agreements , not like we have now . 
we must make an appeal on that basis . 
is leave granted , honourable senators ? 
incidentally , I urge all honourable senators to read the report . 
we in turn are interested in their grasp of the idea that adversarial but peaceful debate does not lead to social and political instability but , in fact , enhances that stability . 
there are so many complex reasons why we feel obliged to maintain life at any cost , even if this is contrary to the patient ' s wishes and detrimental to his or her dignity and peace . 
as I said before and continue to say , workers are the victims in this case and this is unacceptable . 
" welcome to Kingston . 
i return to the point that I made here at second reading . 
in debate in the House of Commons , many have referred to the O . J . Simpson case , who was not driving in a manner dangerous to the public . 
however , in order to ensure that we do not do anything wrong - this is crucial because our privacy , once lost , can never be regained - it is vital that the definition section ensure that professionals and , for that matter , NGOs , are properly covered . 
that is what is committed now . 
when members of parliament try to get information from the access to information department on crown corporations , we run into a virtual roadblock because crown corporations do not have to be accountable for the way they run their business . 
Mr. Speaker , I have also listened to my colleague . 
are there programs being administered far from the people by either the provincial governments or the federal government that could be better and more cost effectively administered by the government closest to the people , the municipal government ? 
their VISA bill is about to explode . 
nays 
i think you would agree it is improper for the member opposite to say that we are misleading or misrepresenting any of the issues , or that we are misleading our constituents . 
that is not to say that the new flag raised on Parliament Hill on February 15 , 1965 , the red maple leaf , was a novelty in our rather complicated heraldic history ; it certainly was not . 
no one in this country wants to hold back Quebecers against their will . 
i do not wish to see people live only in urban centres . 
the next question is on Motion No. 16 . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 331 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
yet they refuse to accept the result of two democratic referendums . 
i think very sincerely that the member is abusing certain privileges and cannot , as indicated here , use Standing Order 87.6 , which the Chair knows very well , and use the question of the 100 and more signatures to have his bill given precedence .

it is coming up , in almost half the time , to surpassing Mr. Mulroney in the number of times he called closure or time allocation . 
in dealing with this income crisis Reform knew as early as September 1998 that the farm situation in western Canada , in particular , and the cash crop people in Ontario were hitting a financial crunch which they were no longer able to handle totally on their own . 
it is interesting to note that whenever this agreement is referred to in terms of its partners , it almost always lumps the 11 European countries together as one , while leaving Canada as a stand - alone . 
Mr. Rob Anders : 
it will have the ability to monitor the Canadian Arctic ice pack so that there will be aid to Canadian ships navigating in Arctic waters . 
the language of the final agreement , as I have said , follows the wording of the charter to facilitate its application . 
agreed . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
the leadership he has shown in the Foreign Affairs Committee has been , as the younger generation would say , " cool " and truly " awesome " . 
such a committee would go a long way to discharging our duties to the countless millions who have lost their lives or those who have lost other fundamental freedoms . 
we will forge a culture of innovation . 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister justifies wanting to get involved in the Quebec referendum process by saying that the supreme court used the expression " clear majority " 25 times in its ruling and more than 10 times in its conclusion . 
motion No. 114 
i know that members in the Reform Party and Tory Party talk about PR . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt this motion ? 
we know that and we are worried about it because the United States has the Jones Act and the Jones Act protects the United States . 
there are approximately 60,000 new cases of diabetes diagnosed in Canada each and every year .

hon. Ronald J . Duhamel 
Mr. Rick Borotsik 
it is not for nothing that the government is suddenly transforming it into a crown corporation , with its own legislation , that will report to the Minister of Industry . 
however , that would be a matter for the Government of Canada to consider if a recommendation were made to the Governor General of Canada in that context , taking into account that that power has not been used for a very long time . 
if we start doing that to the Supreme Court of Canada within our constitution we are opening up a bigger can of worms than opposition members or anyone else who is claiming that would be the solution . 
there is the document . 
we proposed 41 recommendations , which will be considered at our policy convention in May . 
honourable senators , certainly we want to maximize all of the coal resources in Cape Breton , and to create maximum employment opportunities .

the next question is on Motion No. 350 . 
that Bill C - 10 , in Clause 5 , be amended 
that is equivalent to 8.6 % of Canada ' s gross domestic product . 
if I were an Australian , I would still be interested in taking part in this debate because I believe that young offenders must be dealt with the same way wherever you live . 
in addition , a company in Newfoundland has developed a sensitive skin , originally developed for space robotic manipulators , that is now being applied to artificial limbs and even car bumpers to control the release of airbags . 
we will continue as it is introduced at this time and reserve the privilege of removing it for debate purposes . 
lastly , if I may conclude on this point , even warnings , cautions and referrals may be done not only by police officers , which the member for Medicine Hat thought was lacking but is in the bill , but also by prosecutors . 
Mr. John Bryden 
why is Canada one of the small group of six nations blocking the accord and putting trade ahead of the protection of health and the environment ? 
we have seen time and time again in this place that the government will say one thing and do another . 
" to avoid any confusion and to ensure that Quebecers continue to enjoy a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information , we submit that bill C - 54 should be amended so as to specifically exclude the federal act from applying to businesses subject to the Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur priv é , which is a Quebec law .

one of the things I noticed after I was elected was that municipal councillors wanted to meet with me regardless of their political affiliation . 
that Vote 10 a in the amount of $ 111,983,945 , under FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE - Grants and contributions , in the Supplementary Estimates ( A ) for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2000 , be concurred in .

Mr. Pierre de Savoye 
the Speaker : 
madam Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I rise to speak today to this bill on electoral reform . 
the next question is on Motion No. 15 . Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am happy because we will get to the bottom of some things . 
why did the HRD minister spend $ 600,000 of taxpayers ' money on a boardwalk boondoggle that did not have the required permits ? 
it is another example of a failure . 
Kenex ' s shipment of birdseed to this company in August was seized by American Customs . 
the Nisga ' a people must understand that Quebec wants out of this cage , that it wants to free itself from this trap , that it wants to look to the future from a different perspective , from the perspective that I explained earlier , whereby a sovereign Quebec will maintain a partnership with its Canadian friends and with the native people with whom we have shared the same territory for a very long time . 
so some consistency is called for on the Reform Party side . 
i would suggest there needs to be some rules around investment . 
my concern comes from lobster fishermen who are eighth and tenth generation fishermen . 
the Douglas fir is extremely well - known in Canada but there is less than a few percent of this old growth forest type that has been left unlogged on Canada ' s west coast . 
it seems to us the only people who are really sticking their necks out to protect citizens from crime are police officers , particularly the ones who work on the streets . 
i find it a bit incongruous that government members are not standing to debate and defend the Nisga ' a agreement .

Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present a petition imploring the government to take no action to remove section 43 of the criminal code which , Mr. Speaker , as you realize , is that section of the criminal code that sanctions reasonable force in the disciplining of children by parents . 
we have to put some emphasis on that as that would bring relief to the prairies and add value to the products . 
i wish at this time to reserve my right with respect to what I consider unparliamentary language to have an opportunity to examine the record and to come back to this matter at a subsequent sitting of the Senate . 
liberal House of Commons members Dan McTeague and Paul Steckle also attended , as did John Nunziata , a former Liberal member and now an independent , as did several Reform Party members . 
in making this statement , I have attempted to summarize the possibilities with some thoroughness , but I am not certain that I have actually exhausted all possibilities .

honourable senators , at the fourth annual conference of provincial premiers , held in Quebec City in August 1999 , the premiers and the territorial leaders called upon the government to fully restore funding under the Canada Health and Social Transfer to the 1994 - 95 level and to include a suitable indexation formula for CHST transfers to reflect increased costs and pressure on services .

the sex offences that will be flagged on CPIC will be specified , as will the factors that are considered by the Solicitor General in making his decision whether or not to unseal a record . 
this is in many ways the most serious of all . 
honourable senators , can the minister tell us whether he was consulted by the Minister of Finance in drafting the provisions in the budget in relation to the fisheries ? 
that is precisely the point . 
what would be his agenda ? 
at this time the federal government alone spends $ 9,000 for every aboriginal man , woman and child on a reserve in this country . 
in short , he could have acted responsibly and democratically in the spirit of the court ' s opinion and reflected the longing of Canadians for constructive nation building , but to date he has chosen not to do so .

two wrongs do not make a right . 
when we look at the political uncertainty and see the impact on business and job creation , when we look at the social problems in Quebec resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the referendum , it is very clear that there is a downside , and that is why Canada will never break up .

they call for businesses to identify the purpose for which information is collected , to obtain the individual ' s consent regarding collection , to use and disclose personal information , and to provide measures allowing for access to records and organizational accountability .

these people , whether they were fishermen or natives , all said in their own way that this bill duplicates the work of Fisheries and Oceans Canada . 
if the plan is to simply continue with the pipeline of cash and create a dependency in Cape Breton , then it is probably not enough money because there is not enough money . 
Mr. Speaker , I listened carefully and I certainly appreciate the comments of the member .

it is not much of a commitment to working people in the country .

Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister has made it very clear , as have the Liberals on the finance committee and grassroots Liberals from coast to coast , that they support the necessity of bringing down tax cuts . 
along with a fine ceremony that was held in the Railway Committee Room and attended by our own Speaker , who has been very supportive of this issue , we heard from a little 11 - year - old boy , Marc Charron , who lost his sight two years ago to cancer .

hon. Don Boudria

the Bloc Quebecois , which drew on invaluable testimony gathered at public hearings , considers that there is an obvious lack of transparency in the operation of the EDC .

however , we have to be compelled somewhat by his own deep feelings and belief in this regard . 
Mr. Scott Brison 
we know what happens if we do not . 
the people purportedly to whom the service is given do not reap the full benefit they could , judging by the tax burden that they are under . 
they were readily available to anybody who wanted them . 
that is what we are talking about . 
what that means , Madam Speaker , is the fathers of confederation , circa 1982 , were uncomfortable with the fact that if you put the supreme court in the constitution then it becomes equally powerful to parliament . 
i hope the decision would not be arbitrary and capricious , but there is nothing in the bill or the act that would prevent that from happening . 
Ms. Susan Whelan 
as with us all , is it that same old guy who will eventually catch us all ?

we will also see income taxes go up because of bracket creep . 
Mr. Speaker , I know the hon. member shares my conviction that Canadians support , want and are best served by a system of public health care in this country .

it was almost unanimously voted on . 
in the early 1980 s , when the House of Lords was discussing proceeding with broadcasts , some peers echoed a similar concern . 
in his riding this poll showed that 92.21 % of the people opposed the Nisga ' a treaty . 
Mr. Speaker , to get back to the memo that comes from the transitional jobs fund dealing with grants and how they are approved , it says that the minister and her officials say that each region was using its own approach in considering if a pocket was or was not eligible . 
the Parties will negotiate and attempt to reach agreements in respect of grants , between them , in lieu of property taxes . 
foreign carriers serving Canada also generally either exempt themselves completely from any liability or impose very restrictive limits on the extent of their liability . 
they are divided , that is true . 
what piece of equipment would we use to extract those people and bring them to safety were we to face such a requirement today ?

honourable senators , you may be interested to know that , since 1976 , 24 tax convention bills have been introduced in Parliament and in the past two years alone conventions or protocols have been established with 14 countries . 
we question which ones should get the money and where that money should come from . 
less than one - third of the honourable senators in this house would have an opportunity to participate in the debate .... 
the minister has said she brought this forward because she wanted to be transparent . 
the hon. member for Edmonton North has the floor . 
parliament ' s role is at all times to take measures which not only do not jeopardize the unity of the country but , rather , enhance it .

it is just unbelievable what the hon. member has just said .

members 
i declare Motion No. 298 defeated . 
members 
when property rights are respected , there is little conflict between sustainable development and both habitat and resource management . 
the Hon. the Speaker pro tempore : 
members 
when I listened to their voices , there was the trembling that comes from holding back tears . 
madam Speaker , I rise in the House today to speak on the new Canada elections act , Bill C - 2 . 
i would like to take a moment to reference the speech made yesterday by the member for Windsor - St. 
( a ) by replacing line 4 on page 160 with the following : 
i cannot understand why the minister is persisting with a ridiculous and stupid provision in the bill that has already been struck down by the courts . 
the request from the opposition is quite clear . 
honourable senators , this exchange and , in particular , the interesting presentation by Senator Carstairs brought to mind Bill C - 31 , which I had the displeasure of handling in the House of Commons way back in the early 1980 s . 
i declare Motion No. 82 lost on division . 
should we have to answer on the ballot the question " Do you understand the question you have just answered , yes or no ? " 
i point out to the thousands of people watching at home that there are people in the gallery watching this proceeding . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard 
the federation is the single largest organization representing workers ' interests in the province . 
he did not reply . 
canada appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee on March 26 , 1999 , in New York . 
concerning this first part of the preamble , it is easy to understand that Tourisme Qu é bec does not want to give rise to identity squabbles , but simply sell a distinctive tourist destination . 
1994 - 3.43 million tonnes 
Mr. John Harvard 
i would remind hon. members that all questions should be put through the Chair . 
bill C - 409 . 
it shows that children who witness abuse between their parents are affected as much as if they were abused themselves . 
why do the Liberals limit work on smoking problems and merely treat the diseases that flow from chronic , long term tobacco use ? 
i am satisfied that it conforms to the basic principles of a free and democratic society and I will support it . 
that is why the Nisga ' a deal should be subject to the broadest and most careful public scrutiny . 
i forgot to say that when I started . 
let us read along and see if I am a hypocrite . 
it has made it easier to save for a child ' s education .

the Speaker : 
hon. Lorne Nystrom 
i believe the Bloc Quebecois has shown the way in the last few years . 
the minister assured Canadians that extra resources would be dedicated to expedite the process . 
Mr. Speaker , I have the privilege of presenting another petition containing 203 signatures of Canadians from coast to coast who wish to add parental rights , responsibilities and liberty to the charter of rights and freedoms . 
senator Boudreau : 
the member across has indicated that this is a debate which has been around for centuries . 
tell the patients crammed into emergency rooms that everything is fine . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
that is a lot of money , but if we spread it out over a number of years it is something the government could well afford within the budget surplus . 
this crisis is the direct result of its inability to show leadership and provide a sincere commitment to the people of the island . 
could the member address those questions ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
what is the answer ? 
what they did is an example to all . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi - Baie - James - Nunavik , Lib . ) : 
unlike governments in the depression that could not offer much help , there is some money . 
that should be part of what is happening here as well . 
Mr. Louis Plamondon : 
i would like to once again return to recommendation 73 of the Westray report . 
they are urgently required . 
this is the man who has taken on the enormous task of trying to solve the Middle East problem . 
the refusal of the provincial or federal governments to allow the people of British Columbia to voice their approval or disapproval for this agreement , Canadians being what they are when told they will not have a voice , results in the net effect of increasing their opposition to whatever is wanted , not decreasing it . 
since the beginning I have said that I would respect the decisions of the chiefs , and that continues to be my position . 
hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
she says it harms women ' s rights . 
canada LABOUR CODE 
hear , hear ! 
Mr. Speaker , Saskatchewan grandmother and farmer , Lillian Kurtz , has been driven to hunger strike because the Liberal government is ignoring her pleas to address the farm income crisis . 
Mr. Speaker , first , I would like to congratulate the member for Louis - H é bert for all the work she is now doing on GMOs . 
there are working groups that are trying to deal with this issue . 
member of the Committee 
Mr. Myron Thompson 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
this morning , I heard the Secretary of State for Rural Development tell us how dedicated he was to taking his responsibilities seriously . 
Mr. Yvon Godin 
how badly does a Liberal cabinet minister have to mess up before she is asked to resign ? 
i wonder if the hon. member who just spoke would be able to have the same kind of impact on the other members opposite and let them understand exactly how significant the family farm is . 
on January 15 , 1999 , the hearing before Mr. Teitelbaum took place and Mr. Justice Teitelbaum ruled on March 5 . 
this is the way we express democracy in Canada . 
we are privileged to live in a country that allows all Canadians , regardless of sex , race , religious belief or linguistic preferences to strive and realize their dreams and aspirations . 
science AND ENGINEERING 
we have municipal governments , urban hamlets , towns and villages , rural municipalities , counties , school boards , hospital boards , provincial governments , the federal House of Commons and the Senate . 
it believes in balanced legislation . 
is there unanimous consent for the hon. member to table this document ? 
for further clarity , and we never pretend that it is easy to get there from where we are , the aim is one law for aboriginals and non - aboriginals alike . 
we believe in the importance of Bill C - 54 and the importance of adding amendments related to health information '' . 
i do not believe that once they get past seven parents will have a tremendous influence . 
five years ago , the " purple book " was released , proposing a new regulatory system , recognizing the inherent conflict of interest of Agriculture Canada as both the promoter and regulator of pest control products . 
let us not ruin the marketplace by putting in artificial unsustainable rules . 
hon. Mabel M. DeWare : 
Mr. Speaker , the government House leader has wasted a once in three decades opportunity to modernize the elections act . 
it is right for the federal government to help Canadians restore some of their lost disposable income . 
the NDP have sponsored a motion but the seconder is not in her seat . 
honourable senators , I agree with the honourable senator that it is appropriate for the answer to come through this chamber . 
the motion called on parliament to take all necessary steps to preserve the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others . 
Mr. Speaker , federal public servants have been waiting 15 years for pay equity . 
we are governing in a balanced way . 
Ms. Jean Augustine : 
at that time , we thought that battle had long been won , but it appears that nothing has been gained . 
i have heard the comments about what is happening on the east coast of Canada . 
it is painted in many different colours across the country and varies over time . 
so much for what Ms. Francis had to say about the Nisga ' a treaty . 
so that this is clear for those listening , the principle of recognizing same sex spouses flows not just from extremely noble sentiments between individuals , that is reciprocal love , but from the recognition enshrined in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
in light of that , could the minister assure us that the upcoming legislation on financial services will contain provisions for protecting jobs and allowing communities to veto a bank closure where the closure is not in the interest of the community ? 
the petition calls upon the House to encourage the federal government to financially support the clean - up of St. John ' s harbour . 
what is the point of standing up and bringing something forward that has already been addressed ? 
when the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that , whether the question is clear or not , he does not want Quebecers to decide democratically on sovereignty , what is the point of introducing a bill ? 
very few people pay income tax that way . 
does the bill represent an indepth systemic look at the situation in Canada today when it comes to elections law and elections provisions ? 
we are not only sending human beings into space . 
i like to be positive , so I suggest that the honourable Leader of the Government reflect , with all his colleagues , on proposing a motion to the Senate , to remind those who are responsible , that Ottawa should reflect what Canada is all about . 
the Governor General is one skein in the woven fabric of what Eugene Forsey characterised as our " independent sovereign democracy '' . 
i echo the words of the member for Regina - Qu ' Appelle in saying that we need more fundamental electoral reform to democratize this system of government so that the choices that Canadians make , the plurality of political opinions , are actually reflected in the House of Commons . 
members 
we did not accept them in the Uruguay round and we will not accept them in the next round . 
Mr. Speaker , I do not have the information on this specific project . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to read a little referendum that just took place last week in the riding of the member for Skeena . 
that Bill C - 9 be amended by adding after line 29 on page 7 the following new clause : 
he asks if it is any wonder that even deported criminals and undesirables keep on coming back . 
i remind him that section 20 , paragraph 2 of the CSIS act says specifically that the minister in turn must send the report with his comments to the Attorney General of Canada and SIRC . 
hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
he knows as well as I do that if there is an accusation that he or anyone else is making regarding electoral contributions , the proper way to make it is through the commissioner of elections . 
the Liberals came to power in November , 1993 , and quickly went to work piling every conceivable expenditure onto that figure to raise it to as high a level as possible before the end of the 1993 - 94 fiscal year which ended in March , 1994 . They had five months to do their handiwork . 
question Period 
Mr. Preston Manning 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
we have not learned how to help the dying , and for many of us , death is synonymous with failure . 
motion No. 120 negatived 
the fact is that it is often much easier to identify anticipated costs associated with regulations than the benefits they may eventually provide . 
when individuals are referred to the program there is a quick turnaround between the time they commit the offence and the time they come before the youth justice committee . 
however , I hesitate a bit on this issue , because we know that increasingly , with changes in society , the issue of jurisdiction is becoming increasingly grey . 
Yes. 
Mr. Speaker , one of the ways in which government makes sure the money it spends is well spent is to involve the local people . 
the national DNA data bank will help to identify suspects more quickly and speed up criminal investigations . 
we have to take risks . 
we believe in co - operation . 
that Vote 50 a in the amount of $ 354,000 , under FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE - International Joint Commission - Program expenditures , in the Supplementary Estimates ( A ) for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2000 , be concurred in . 
people who have more money at their disposal will stimulate the demand for goods and in turn will create more jobs . 
as members know , today the Minister of Health is meeting with the tobacco industry ' s most celebrated whistleblower , Jeffrey Wigand . 
we have a government that is completely out of control . 
Mr. Speaker , again I want to make it clear that I did not personally approve projects in my riding after becoming minister . 
child POVERTY 
we would like to see a legislative review . 
as such , we are committed to ensuring that measures are in place for new and existing Canadian carriers to expand into the domestic market . 
Mr. Speaker , I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Vancouver - Quadra . 
labour 
using Nisga ' a as a template , and God forbid , it will not only create economic uncertainty in certain parts adjoining there , but throughout the rest of the province as well . 
Mr. Speaker , it shows how up to date our party and our government is compared to the hon. member ' s party . 
it is an independent statutory body with 15 commissioners and centres in London and Manchester . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik 
i would like to cite from Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , citation 54 , it is considered a breach to alter the debates when : 
can the minister assure us that she will do her utmost to shed light on this issue , even if some people close to the Liberal party might be directly involved ? 
honourable senators , the answer must be no to the the honourable senator ' s assumption . 
in young adults , smoking rates have rebounded to pre - 1989 levels . 
Mr. Claude Bachand : 
other criminal justice issues cry out for attention . 
hon. Senators : 
and I have no doubts that the agency will protect the interests of Canadians , and that it will protect the Canadian industry so that it will be operated by Canadians in Canada . 
we have seen 1,400 jobs lost just with one of the banks involved since then because of the merger decision . 
if the Prime Minister will not agree to release the documentation , then we need an independent public inquiry to get to the bottom of this . 
* * * 
if the House gives its consent , I intend to move concurrence in the ninth report later this day . 
certainly not . 
they have been restricted from a right to even write their own will . 
Japan at one time was at odds with Europe and certainly North America . 
the Speaker 
what , then , is the real problem ? 
Mr. Speaker , this week representatives of 135 sovereign nations are gathered in Seattle to launch the next set of global trade negotiations . 
people will be penalized if the department has stalled their application , or if it is moving slowly through the process for whatever reason . 
that is a one man decision . 
i have witnessed firsthand the terrible price women and children have paid through the native patriarchal system . 
motion agreed to . 
a lot of us did not think that was a good idea . 
i would like to ask the members in the House to take note of the numbers , of the consensus and of a way of doing things that has been proven to work . 
on the other hand , there is evidence that key policies like the level of rent to income paid by tenants can be unilaterally changed at the will of the provinces . 
motion agreed to . 
Mr. Speaker , everybody knows about it . 
one was put forward by my colleague from North Vancouver , who has worked a great deal on the bill trying to improve it . 
i would be completely remiss if I did not address the ongoing problems in human resources development . 
natural DISASTERS 
members 
a friend ' s family went through this . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron 
therefore , I would ask him to be quite succinct in his presentation . 
a similar situation exists in The Netherlands , a unitary state with 12 administrative regions or provinces , but it is a more radical case . 
we have been opening the mortgages and giving more time for payments . 
this is not the first time this has happened . 
cabinet ministers do not need to play by the rules so maybe we could give her another chance . 
the government has nothing to brag about when it comes to poverty , which is growing in Canada . 
many fishers to whom we have talked had no idea that such a bill had been introduced , much less any knowledge of its contents . 
the next question is on Motion No. 152 . 
( 2 ) The committee designated or established for the purpose of subsection ( 1 ) shall , as soon as practicable , undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions and operation of this Act and shall , within three years after the review is undertaken , submit a report to the House of Commons . " 
it is not unusual for 90 per cent of the able - bodied men and women in an aboriginal community to be unemployed . 
yesterday , during oral question period , many members of all opposition parties called for the minister to resign . 
an hon. member : 
heritage 
i would encourage other hon. members to do the same . 
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) moved : 
last week , the Quebec team proved it once again by winning the third snow sculpture competition here on Parliament Hill . 
i hope to do that in the next few days . 
national CAPITAL COMMISSION 
i will draw attention to one analysis . 
having said that , I also want to bring the hon. member ' s attention to the plan of action we are implementing that will review all the active files that have been part and parcel of the grants and contributions . 
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to the best of my knowledge , under our rules , when a letter is quoted the actual document must be tabled , whatever the document is . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
some hon. members : 
i should like to endorse Senator Lynch - Staunton ' s suggestion that the commissioner come here . 
if so , it is also because prices are high . 
since August 13 , when the governor in council put in place the section 47 order , both Air Canada and Canadian Airlines , and any interested third parties , have had the freedom to develop and discuss any proposal which might lead to a conditional agreement . 
Mr. Lee Morrison 
procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Ken Epp 
i am concerned when I hear some people say that young people should be punished more harshly . 
the Government of Canada therefore reaffirms the commitment it has made to Quebecers and all other Canadians that the principle of clarity as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada , will be respected . 
a measure to turn boats back , which recalls some of the darker moments in Canada ' s past , would run the risk of denying protection to people who could be determined , through our hearings , to be genuine refugees . 
we could not get a response from the minister ' s office . 
bill C - 20 . Second Reading 
all in attendance felt that the government must lead the way in long term planning , setting outcomes and filling the gaps within a framework that reflects Canadian values . 
Mr. Speaker , many Canadians were concerned some weeks ago when the Prime Minister uncritically dismissed the concern that many Canadians have about the selling of a Candu reactor to Turkey . 
the question is on the motion . 
our ability to adopt innovative environmental practices and technologies will increasingly be part of Canada ' s strength in the 21 st century . 
he says that " when politicians horse trade core political rights and negotiate open and financial commitments , taxpayers deserve a vote on it '' . 
this single act meant that 75,000 new social housing units that had been targeted for construction were never built , a decision that has denied tens of thousands of families the right to decent and affordable housing . 
this bill was introduced in its original form in 1987 as a reaction to two events . 
where do these members stand ? 
i would go even further to say that they need to see this bill become law and they need to know that the tragic death of a man they loved and respected , a man who gave so much of himself , will lead to a law that will improve safety on our streets , a law that will help save the lives of other police officers throughout Canada and a law that will severely punish those individuals who put our communities at risk . 
we talked about what they were experiencing . 
it is evident that the issues that a unilateral abrogation of the ABM Treaty would raise are significant and very far - reaching . 
* * * 
therefore , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) , the bill is deemed to have been adopted at all stages and passed by the House . 
therefore , the Gitanyow were not overly worried or too aggressive about the land claims process . 
as I speak , the elderly , poor and wounded civilians left behind in Grozny face imminent starvation and death . 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member talks about novels and novel foods in the same breath . 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague is right . 
Mr. Speaker , on this the last sitting day of the House of Commons in this century , it is time to reflect on the issues that face Canadians . 
( division 150 ) 
madam Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague in the Conservative Party for addressing the need for a greater audience to hear these words of wisdom with regard to our electoral process in Canada . 
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I wish to thank you for your patience , but I would like a directive . 
that is found at page 46 of the defence white paper . 
a governing council will be appointed to set the priorities and the goals of Canadian health research in all institutes . 
we know that for the 20 years that negotiations took place , especially the last few years , advisory committees were involved and public hearings were held by various organizations . 
this is not a laughing matter . 
accordingly , pursuant to Standing Order 76 ( 5 ) , they have not been selected . 
notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Permit Electronic Coverage 
faced with the confusing question of the 1980 referendum , the then Prime Minister stated on May 14 , 1980 that , if the yes side obtained a majority , he would say to the then Premier of Quebec - and I am quoting the Prime Minister of Canada , Pierre Elliott Trudeau - `` If you knock on the sovereignty - association door , there is no negotiation possible '' . 
the committee then went on to state that Canada should not " Leave its human rights values at the door " in its commercial and other dealings with countries . 
i know it is heresy among some members opposite that other Canadians should have an opinion , that they should have a say , that they should have a vote in the breakup of their country which they and their ancestors worked so hard to make work and built together as a unique country , one well worth saving . 
committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
the government policy is to leak things through the press rather than have any meaningful debate or interaction with members of the opposition . 
i will recognize the hon. member for Sudbury on debate and she will have the floor when we return . 
( division 202 ) 
the petition states that the strength of any society is largely dependent upon a solid family unit headed by a father and a mother living in a heterosexual relationship . 
when those people are there because they have taken the time to prepare a presentation , I will be there to hear them . 
perhaps not as many as we would like , of course , because some members are turning a deaf ear , but I say that the way political parties are funded is very important in a democracy . 
fortunately , in such situations , solutions can usually be found . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
the lifestyle of average band members , despite the billions of dollars , has not changed . 
in Canada , the Minister of Health introduced a bill a week ago today , Bill C - 13 , structured in the same fashion as the bill we are talking about today . 
there must be some reason for it . 
we continue to believe that moving citizenship decision making from a quasi - judicial process to one that is administrative makes sense in every way . 
members 
the honourable senator may wish to answer this query later and tie it to the response to Senator Kinsella . 
this city is in effect bilingual today because the demand for services makes it an advantage for citizens to be able speak and understand two languages . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :

Mr. Guy St - Julien 
motion No. 38 
how can a national government establish effective fiscal measures in a world economy ? 
farmers are going bankrupt . 
nays 
i wonder why she is not here to listen to our speakers . 
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) : 
however , normally the enforcement occurs when a member wishes to address the House . 
i think Quebecers will see with this initiative , as with others , that Canadian federalism does not serve them properly , it does not provide them with what they expect . 
it said that it was up to the political actors , to the elected representatives , to determine what constituted a clear majority in the case of a referendum . 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
i can only assume then , that the Constitutional Amendment Act , Bill C - 110 , also supplants the Constitution . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
i understand that the tradition of throwing paper in the Manitoba chamber has now come to a halt . 
could the minister please explain to Canadians why he invoked section 47 when he did ? 
nil 
highway 401 is one of the busiest stretches , if not the busiest highway in the world . 
we boast a number of truly interesting tourist attractions and it is not mere chance , but rather the result of a well - organized tourism effort , that has led to worthwhile results . 
i was delighted to hear those comments . 
i do not want to sully this debate any further by cheap reflection on the type of debate I have heard here already from the opposite party . 
( division 606 ) 
while she rightly points out that she saw no evidence of widespread intentional policy to persecute religious groups , I think she would agree that the broader picture is not one that her committee could justifiably analyze . 
all these political speeches are very impressive , but the regions are being left to fend for themselves . 
undoubtedly , Inter - Canadien is a victim of policies and actions which were designed to benefit other industry participants , many of whom have a competitive interest in the demise of Inter - Canadien . 
however , because the role of the Senate in participating in the deliberations on the establishment of clarity is controversial , would the senator give us his views on the manner in which the bill speaks about the role of the Senate ? 
this would give a huge advantage to the Liberals by restricting the ability of any other person or group to counter government propaganda during an election . 
i am struck by the contrast : the toughness of Air Canada purporting to tell us what they will and will not accept , and the rather compliant and passive attitude of the Minister of Transport . 
this will ensure that the government will be in a position to fulfil its obligations toward Canadians without ending with a deficit because of some unforeseen economic hardship . 
first Reading 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the third time ? 
there is more than one party involved in this whole process . 
the potential negative effects could be mitigated by allowing any domestic carrier to purchase points in the dominant carrier ' s frequent flyer plan at a reasonable cost , or by the dominant carrier ' s participation in independent loyalty programs . 
the next question is on Motion No. 221 . 
she said that Duchess Foods never asked for a grant and that , in fact , Duchess Foods never asked for anything at all . 
it deals with dozens and dozens of different issues . 
the Speaker : 
in the Government of Quebec ' s legislation , the consent for release of specific information must be very clear . 
this weak Liberal government has no political will and no vision . 
before any thought is given to this option , the complex underlying issues must be resolved , particularly as regards the services available to victims and the co - ordination of action by the federal , provincial and territorial governments . 
as a result they went from a lead in the polls prior to the election call to finishing a dismal third and almost losing their deposit . 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
federal and provincial bills must be presented to the Governor General and the Lieutenant - Governor , respectively , for Royal Assent . 
it is quite clear that we are responding positively to the daunting task of preparing Canada for the new millennium ; and yes , we are prepared . 
and the bells having rung : 
nays 
it chooses to talk the talk but do nothing . 
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is out of touch when he says that the people have already had their referendum when they elected MPs sitting in the House . 
the reason it is important , not just the few quotes from today but the entire binder of information it has on each and every member of parliament in this place , is that there is a gag order . 
this is where people need the most protection at this time , where personal information can travel broadly without even the knowledge of the person affected . 
time and time again the Canadian forces have responded admirably to domestic emergencies from the ice storm to major floods and search and rescue missions . 
how does it change the constitution ? 
Mr. Speaker , John McRae wrote those words 100 years ago to commemorate the brave Canadian soldiers who fought in the Battle of Paardeberg on February 27 , 1900 . 
i think she has the right to hear them . 
once the Senate has given its approval , it will be law . 
they will also have a voice on the board of the health institution , because it may be faster to seek care at the village hospital or dispensary than to go to Terrace or Rupert . 
on the Order : 
on the eve of an election , it sounds good does it not , Mr. Speaker ? 
recognized for his determination to have a free hand in performing his duties , Mr. Rabinovitch , we hope , will feel freed of the old Trudeau demons , who wanted the CBC to be an instrument of Canadian unity . 
i think that is what Canadians want and it is what all of us need . 
that bill was debated in the House and sent to committee . 
the Foreign Investment Review Agency , which drove away foreign capital , was abolished . 
is there unanimous consent ? 
are Reform Party members proud of what they have said , that they would not cut EI premiums for employees ? 
the government has a really bad habit as a majority government . 
do I have unanimous consent to help - 
they were defending some fundamental principles , as if they were speaking on a motion to protect personal information . 
it is for that reason co - operatives have grown . 
even if parliament were to reject the present bill , it would face this issue once again in a relatively short time . 
the petition concerns the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board . 
that really fouls up the people who are watching on television who of course outnumber the people in the House now by about about 10 million to one . 
as the hon. member for Mercier said quite clearly , in Quebec , there is another example of a principle that works . 
moreover , the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Quebec government is launching initiatives aimed at protecting the environment , particularly the marine floor . 
the privacy commissioner goes on to say that the bill is a major leap forward by providing a mechanism for independent oversight , mandating the Privacy Commissioner of Canada to investigate complaints , issue reports and conduct audits . 
( a ) any structure or work , unless it is 
we must ensure that our increased trade and our improved economy are matched by an increased capacity to move people and things in complete safety . 
Dryden ' s immediate successors were Thomas Shadwell , Nahum Tate , Nicholas Rowe , Laurence Eusden , Colley Cibber , William Whitehead , Thomas Warton , Henry Pye , and Robert Southey . 
let me go through those concerns , because it will help to reveal how much disregard the government had for the process . 
the member for St. Albert is quite correct . 
Mr. Monte Solberg 
routine PROCEEDINGS 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the Privacy Commissioner will investigate and mediate disputes and investigate complaints . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the Prime Minister likes to say he is all alone . 
remember that for years Air Canada was an extremely successful crown corporation . 
as Senator Andreychuk reminded us yesterday , Bill C - 7 is certainly not a panacea . 
we are adding to a major bureaucracy . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
i think we must recognize that statement . 
the survival of the official languages is what a united Canada is all about .

would it not be nice if we could take the $ 2.15 a bushel return to the farmer , take some of the GST and give it back to the farmer and tell him he will now get $ 5 a bushel ? 
you have seriously underestimated the consequences of your ill - conceived action and I feel certain that there will be considerable unrest in B.C. as the general population start to understand more fully the mess your governments have created for us .

i certainly do not want to speak and am quite prepared to listen to Senator Oliver . 
with respect to what specific action might be undertaken by the Government of Canada on behalf of individual shareholders in terms of protecting their financial interests or directing the company to take certain actions respecting the shareholders themselves , I am still unclear as to the honourable senator ' s suggestion . 
in northern Manitoba we do not have the majority of the population , but the people who are there strongly believe in the north . 
the executive in charge gave us a tour and explained that the rink was 80 per cent finished and would be ready for 2000 - and it has a seating capacity of 12,000 - at a cost of $ 75 million . 
the honourable senator himself made the following statement about section 35 , as found at page 910 of the Debates of the Senate of Thursday , March 30 , 2000 : 
some hon. members : 
now it is the responsibility of Canada to accept and finalize the agreement reached in good faith between the parties . 
finally , eliminating or reducing the double taxation that would otherwise arise in international operations will be the biggest benefit . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
however , she believes it could fall short of attaining its goal to protect health care providers who seek to honour their patients ' wishes . 
agreed . 
honourable senators , increasingly , all committees are seeking authorization from the Senate to broadcast their public hearings on the radio and television . 
i really do think that we should have considered in the legislation the possibility of publicizing the identities of young offenders who have been convicted of summary offences . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard 
farm Credit Corporation , FCC , has expanded the plant now pay later loan to include all fruit and berry varieties grown for commercial production across Canada . 
we know that on November 24 , 1989 , the House of Commons unanimously resolved to end child poverty in Canada by the year 2000 . 
i have enormous concerns about what the federal government might be tempted to do in future , even if this is a crown corporation . 
* * * 
we have to protect the environment of our government . 
i will check for quorum immediately . 
a number of factors may give some indication , including life expectancy , the quality of one ' s physical environment and the crime and poverty rates , but other factors are subjective . 
it was a local firm , albeit , but everyone ' s personal medical records were in the hands of a private company . 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 425 , an act to provide for the harmonization of environmental standards throughout Canada . 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to see progress being made in the relationship between municipalities and senior levels of both the provincial and federal governments . 
it has an ethics chair and professors who work in this field . 
that is what the government has done on so many other issues . 
thus , there would be no question that the geographical territory would be totally bilingual . 
the answer is no . 
is the finance minister going to decide who is viable and who is not viable ? 
however , after four months of inactivity , I was expecting to hear something about the throne speech . 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that you too will find the following news both shocking and appalling . 
i am glad the member has raised this point . 
Mr. Speaker , the insults hurled by members opposite at the Minister for International Trade are not justified . 
probably our pockets in Canada are not as deep as those in some other countries . 
also , the provincial legislature ' s standing committee on aboriginal affairs held hearings in a number of British Columbia communities . 
again , this is not about family or marriage . 
Mr. Speaker , I listened carefully to the hon. member ' s comments and , as with others , I appreciate the passion and concern with which she expressed her views . 
that is what the whole system is about . 
our Canadian courts have done away with that . 
i declare Motion No. 362 lost . 
however , it has always stood in the House and said " If you can ' t stand on your own , then you had better get out of the way '' . 
we hear that there are other priorities , right now , in Canada besides reforming the Elections Act , which is already very democratic . 
inquiries in the 1970 s and 1980 s were inconclusive , and no one has been charged to date . 
because once again the committee demonstrated very clearly that it was not demonstrating the autonomy that it ought to have if it was going to have credibility as an institution . 
could the Leader of the Government please release a projection as to how much of the original scholarship endowment will be diverted away from our Canadian students in need over the full 1998 - 2010 period just to operate this private foundation ? 
( the House divided on Motion No. 307 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
members will not be entitled to contribute or accrue any benefits for service after December 31 , 2000 . 
as mentioned previously , where crimes do occur I believe that there must be meaningful consequences . 
currently our farmers are faced with some of the lowest commodity prices seen for a long time . 
the Government of Canada is committed to protecting the public interest in issues such as pricing , service to small communities and the rights and concerns of airline employees . 
no other delivery company is legally required to offer affordable uniform service in every corner of the nation while maintaining financial self - sufficiency . 
the whip of the Bloc Quebecois has requested the unanimous consent of the House to have the names of all members of the Bloc who were not in the House applied to the vote . 
he has been a voice for fairness in this city , in this province and in this country for the many years that I have known him . 
the minister is also believed to be considering a transitional fund for farmers who decide to leave the land and switch careers . 
i attended the meetings in Estevan and Regina . 
only when the so - called " crisis " seemed imminent did the government attempted to act . 
the more serious lesson today involves the commissioner ' s 50:50 plan . 
division No. 292 
senator Corbin : 
solicitor GENERAL OF CANADA 
the Speaker : 
third , the bill does not address the broader implications that arise from an amendment to the general age of consent . 
the bill also seeks to eliminate the two categories of unemployed created by the current legislation , namely those who worked 700 hours and those who worked less than 700 hours . 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
* * * 
that is $ 900 million , honourable senators . 
i have here a document about the dignity of standing up as a people . 
( division 535 ) 
as Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz told La Presse regarding our new member of Parliament : 
the official opposition believes in sustainable development and management of the environment to both preserve biodiversity and conserve the environment for the enjoyment of Canadians at present and in the future . 
let us stick to the facts . 
immigration 
how would we solve a dispute ? 
criminal CODE 
Mr. John McKay 
i refer you also , Mr. Speaker , to the 13 th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , the subcommittee that examined the issue of private members ' business when it considered the various representations to have the 100 signatures as a means of seconding a bill and getting it on the order of precedence . 
Mr. Pierre Brien 
the price we will pay in adopting a " wait and see " or " fix it later " approach in implementing e - commerce legislation is just too high . 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
some hon. members : 
the House met at 10 a.m. 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
the Charter represented a major change in Canadian constitutional life by creating limitations on the powers of both the federal and provincial governments , something totally different from the scheme of the Constitution Act , 1867 . 
fortunately the official opposition is not subject to any of these conflicts or restrictions . 
my colleague from Dauphin - Swan River was one who was concerned as well when he was mayor . 
i am not giving my speech today , but if we were to do it , we would certainly be on business outside of the Senate . 
the phones are ringing from British Columbia because the Reform Party is refusing permission to travel to British Columbia to hear input on the finance committee . 
one of them is the HRDC debacle . 
child POVERTY 
we need an external audit . 
hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) , pursuant to notice of November 2 , 1999 , moved : 
there were great reformers like Joseph Howe and James Uniake of Nova Scotia , Charles Fisher and Lemuel Wilmot of New Brunswick , George Coles of Prince Edward Island , Louis LaFontaine , Augustin Morin and Louis Papineau of Lower Canada , William Baldwin and his son Robert , Sir Francis Hinks and William Lyon Mackenzie of Upper Canada . 
i invite all my colleagues on this side of the House and the House as a whole to support this motion . 
Cape Breton Development Corporation - closure - announced infusion of funds - government policy 
Mr. Rob Anders 
eighty - four percent did not have verification of contracts and 83 % had no supporting documentation . 
the house would last for hundreds of years , except that its wiring was the old cloth wiring from the turn of the century and the place was a fire trap . 
on the evening of the 1995 referendum , the Prime Minister of Canada said , and I quote : " In a democracy the people are always right . 
i table it in your name . 
finally , in response to the honourable senator ' s observation , I suppose that if a federal and provincial government agreed to broader powers than those that exist in the Nisga ' a Final Agreement , those broader powers would be part of that encroaching aboriginal right . 
after we got into the bill , after we heard the testimony and after we drafted the report we recognized that it was hard to take partisan positions because it did not make a lot of sense . 
the treaty will also provide for the means of supervision of judges of the Nisga ' a court by the judicial council of the province of British Columbia or by similar means . 
( motion agreed to ) 
the synergy of these two creates Canada ' s national identity . 
i hope I have been clear enough myself and that , from now on , in the House things will be unassailably clear . 
therefore I urge all members to support the bill . 
since the honourable leader has brought me to this hallowed status with Diane Francis - where I have never been before , I might say , and it will be very brief , I can assure you - is it then the position of the government that more jobs are created by band - aid , transitional programs that come and go than by the permanency which is afforded by tax cuts , by removal of capital gains tax , by all the economic matters which I have referenced ? 
they are us . 
some hon. members : 
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood St. James - Assiniboia , Lib . ) : 
a housing affordability problem occurs when a large portion of a family ' s income is consumed by housing costs to the extent that money for other necessities is lacking . 
my colleague from Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre and my colleagues generally from the New Democratic caucus have called on the Government of Canada to facilitate Taiwan ' s participation in the World Health Organization .

miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
i declare Motion No. 9 lost . 
yea . 
he was imputing ill motive , and by this act of slander was inhibiting the capacity of the member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast to perform his duties in this place . 
business OF THE HOUSE 
on that question the government is totally confused . 
senator Cools : 
an hon. member : 
i cannot see any reason whatsoever for reference to the constitution . 
it ensures that Canadians , whoever they are , are treated with tolerance , compassion and respect . 
child care has been shown over and over again to be the essential ingredient for the work force participation of parents , especially mothers . 
Mr. Jerry Pickard : 
i do not take favours from anyone . 
it was the Liberal government in 1966 that made the assumption and set forth the so - called plan to phase out mining entirely in 15 years . 
that is not to diminish in any way the importance of this type of legislation . 
the miners in Cape Breton have contributed to the building of the country from one coast to the other . 
orders OF THE DAY 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister indicated that it is the plan of the government to send the elections bill to committee before second reading . 
Mr. Andr é Bachand 
that the papers and evidence received and taken on the subject during the First Session of the Thirty - sixth Parliament and any other relevant Parliamentary papers and evidence on the said subject be referred to the Committee ; 
the next question is on Motion No. 109 . 
we hear a great deal in this chamber , and most eloquently recently by Senator St. Germain , about breast cancer . 
bill C - 2 . 
* * * 
i want him to draw his remarks to a quick conclusion because I have to give the hon. member for Medicine Hat time to respond . 
why can the member not use the word future and think about the future of our people rather than hearken back and keep the past locked in place ? 
( division 399 ) 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
it is a very timely , very poignant petition from dozens of residents of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough . 
division No. 538 
in my opinion , this is totally unacceptable and unjustified for the self - employed workers in our communities - and I do not mean the company presidents . 
we are very pleased that seven provincial trade ministers will accompany the Canadian government to the WTO ministerial meeting in December .

he is still the minister of energy . 
madam Speaker , I thank the member for Okanagan - Shuswap for his very pertinent intervention . 
routine PROCEEDINGS 
Mr. Speaker , members of the Bloc Quebecois will be voting no on this motion . 
order , please . 
they have to be involved in this dialogue so they can bring home the issues from the major conferences which are taking place . 
the next question is on Motion No. 44 . 
he said , for example , that on the fundamental issue of freedom of choice on abortion that he supports , personally , a constitutional amendment , as I understand it , to make abortions in Canada illegal , but that he would be prepared to have that issue put to the people of Canada in a referendum . 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill : 
division No. 48 
* * * 
Mr. Mac Harb 
today , it is happening again . 
this , to me , makes a differentiation between whether this is a Senate - House of Commons issue or a person who happens to work in the Senate . 
the future could be disastrous and this arrangement could basically condemn the Nisga ' a people to a life of poverty . 
china - Detention of Catholic Archbishop 
honourable senators , as a representative of Manitoba , I cannot help but rise to reiterate what other senators have said , in particular Senator Sparrow . 
the Nisga ' a government will be obliged to account to the government of the Province of British Columbia for the funds it contributes , and to the Government of Canada for the funds it contributes . 
the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted . 
when she saw that her industry colleague was not acting , and even though this was not her responsibility , the Minister of Labour tried to do something , but the Reform Party member criticized her for it . 
Mr. Speaker , let me try the question in English . 
2 nd Session , 36 th Parliament , 
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) : 
* * * 
an examination of a number of constitutional systems shows that control of the constitutionality of legislation is essential . 
let me explain and the member can have some time to formulate his answer . 
the government expects some applause from Canadians for doing that at a time when Canadians are suffering under the weight of a taxation system which has seen them as the most heavily taxed we have ever been as a society , as a country and as Canadian taxpayers in our history . 
if one of the founding groups does not feel at home , the Canadian federation will not work . 
the CRP funds allowed project proponents to lever another $ 10 million from other federal departments and various other sources . 
if the practices of political funding do not change , democracy will be at risk . 
therefore , we will leave that decision to the chair of the legislative committee . 
at the age of 14 , she took to the streets of Ottawa , Montreal and Toronto . 
the government cannot be blamed for doing something to increase taxation , but it can be blamed however for not reforming the tax system and restoring the full indexation that was abolished in 1985 . 
this would make regional disparities a higher priority in the House of Commons . 
i understand that , but it is time we voted for motherhood and stood up for something that would perhaps help us improve the way this institution operates on behalf of Canadians . 
it is an area where firms are told , for example , that the government wants to establish trade policy to sell Canada on Asian or American markets , and this sort of thing costs lots . 
it will argue that the native fishery is a fishery based on race . 
madam Speaker , for the information of my colleague opposite who said this intergovernmental affairs minister is the best they ever had , which is hardly a compliment for his predecessors , I would like to table a document entitled " The Antidemocratic Drift of the Federal Government '' . 
Mr. Speaker , I am working very hard with those provinces . 
let us look at the cost of a radical change in approach where young offenders are concerned . 
is it against fee simple ? 
Mr. Speaker , the whole issue of young offenders is extremely important , because everyone knows that young people will eventually be part of society . 
it goes on for two pages about the federal government programs that have been withdrawn and the amount of money that has been withdrawn from agriculture , and then I hear today that the provinces are withdrawing some money . 
as we debate the issues of globalization here in the House of Commons , trade meetings are being held on the west coast of North America . 
it is because there is another agenda . 
therefore , honourable senators , our view was that this was more than a modest incentive for people in the health care sector to try to reach a consensus to avoid all the problems they say they are concerned about . 
i do not believe this legislation is something that Canadians can support . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom 
government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
in addition to the other points I have made , I remind the member and I want to tell the public especially that the governing council will appoint , lay off and terminate employees and establish all the standards . 
madam Speaker , I congratulate my colleague on the founding of his family . 
we will protect the Canada Health Act . 
Mr. Scott Brison 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
let me explain . 
members 
we have a small population and we have a large agricultural output . 
the next question is on Motion No. 234 . 
another thing we said was that we would transfer manpower training and we have done that . 
an hon. member : 
i think we will make a note of the fact that the government specifically would not agree to a simple suggestion to make this bill that would protect 14 year olds and those under 16 a votable bill . 
of course , they did not take the risk of going to the courts , being turned down and being told that Quebec had jurisdiction in this area and that , because the federal government did not take up this jurisdiction , the Quebec government had been able to do so . 
i know there are a few on the other side as well and they should understand and empathize with this issue . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 107 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member has not answered my question . 
three years later , the now finance minister steamrolled his own report and in its place introduced a budget that slashed all federal funding for the creation of new social housing units .

orders OF THE DAY 
hon. Gilbert Normand 
( motion No. 105 negatived ) 
Mr. Speaker , the solicitor general is taking great licence with the word immediately . 
Mr. Ovid L . Jackson : 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz 
Mr. John Herron 
the hon. member is recorded as having voted . 
should we really be surprised by the tactics of the Liberal government , since the current Prime Minister is behind all the attacks against Quebec and was more importantly one of the artisans of the night of the long knives ? 
they believe they have a right and a well - earned entitlement to make decisions on their own . 
Mr. Randy White : 
we must ensure that there is open dialogue with both industry and consumers on how we should compete in international and domestic markets . 
increasing competition in the communications market is the best way to encourage network upgrading . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 452 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
that Bill C - 6 be amended by deleting Clause 4.8.3 of Schedule 1 . 
the purpose of Bill C - 213 is to promote shipbuilding in Canada and make Canadian shipyards more competitive . 
instead of spending his time on such a bill , the minister should be focussing more attention on the GM affair . 
we need to come to a settlement , but not with all the clauses that are in there now . 
i heard them again , as I have often heard them in the past , on the subject of francophones outside Quebec . 
we keep hearing how good free trade is . 
an important principle behind federal payment of property taxes is that municipal governments and local taxpayers should not be at a disadvantage for having a federal property in the community which could otherwise be taxed at the applicable rate . 
she said that , in fact , there is a limited utility to doing police record checks because the vast majority of people who will perpetrate abuse against a child or another person have never been convicted of a crime . 
the deputy minister said that it is not up to us as bureaucrats to make these fundamental decisions , that is for Parliament . 
honourable senators , Canada is a bilingual and multicultural federation , as has been acknowledged in our various constitutional laws from 1867 to this day . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te 
honourable senators , would Senator Taylor entertain a question ? 
nays 
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) : 
i am hopeful that government is planning to speed up its planned implementation of the shared parenting recommendations included in " For the Sake of the Children " . 
on that date , we undertook to provide concrete support , such as feasibility studies for potential projects , in order to help identify new job creation avenues . 
maybe with some exceptions , probably most of us here will be alive to see that happen . 
hon. Charlie Watt : 
Mr. Speaker , the unilateral approach being taken by the federal government is not limited to referendum rules . 
we on the government side oppose the motions in Group No. 1 . 
such recommendations would help to eliminate in the short and long term the causes of homelessness and would get the homeless off Canada ' s streets , especially at this time of year . 
remembering the effects of the cod moratorium in Newfoundland , Cape Bretoners are terrified that an entire industry , economy , lifestyle and culture are doomed to extinction . 
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated from the time I was appointed solicitor general , I intend to fight drugs and alcohol in penal institutions across the country . 
on behalf of all non - Liberal Canadians , I demand an apology from the National Capital Commission . 
senator Spivak : 
there is the very important issue of overlap between the Gitksan and the Nisga ' a , and the possible overlap with the Gitanyow . 
culture 
i think we have a duty to do so . 
my job is to ensure this issue is fixed , and I will do that . 
it would establish a dispute advisory panel under the act with a minimum of two board members from each province and territory .

Mr. John Solomon

the Hon. the Speaker : 
in fact , we just had testimony from another airline this morning .

today we speak frankly and openly about how our country might break up through legal and democratic means .

the other group wanted research of this nature totally exempted from provisions of the bill . 
Mr. R é ginald B é lair ( Timmins - James Bay , Lib . ) : 
every time there was a discussion , someone would ask , what about that new professor , John Stewart at - as they say sometimes - St. FX ? 
the Honourable Senator Cools objects . 
there is still no binding means of recourse in the event of a dispute over payment .

the real issue is why the Reform opposed the national child tax benefit . 
senator Oliver : 
senator Cools : 
i doubt very much that anyone in this chamber would support that view . 
the Bloc has moved that the House legislative committee considering Bill C - 20 hold hearings in all regions across the country . 
historically , Canadian and British criminal law has eschewed and rejected definitions of law in terms of motive . 
the vision articulated in the Speech from the Throne was a broad vision for Canada . 
once again , it shows how our institution can play its role as an independent parliamentary institution . 
i am quite concerned because now Senator Austin has just told us that this bill would be non - repealable . 
the government must immediately reduce the burden it places on farmers .

Mr. Speaker , I can confirm to my hon. colleague that Correctional Service Canada is opposing this before the federal court . 
( d ) Since it is not possible to identify individual cases having received financial assistance from the court challenges program , one can only speculate on the effective impact of such funding on the jurisprudence trend in the areas of linguistic and equality rights . 
since 1987 the Canadian Space Agency has allocated over 150 contracts to Canadian firms and universities for automation and robotics technology developed projects , resulting in the development of several new technologies which have already been alluded to by my colleagues in the House .

some hon. members : 
unlike the Ottawa Convention on Landmines that came into force in about 18 months , the Rome Statute will take longer because most countries must make major legislative changes , including amendments to their constitutions . 
the exhaustion and the frustration caused by the uncertainties generated by such crises are felt in Quebec as well and not just by its minority language . 
some hon. members : 
at a discovery of the plaintiff at the federal court on November 3 , 1998 , the plaintiff acknowledged that part of the reason he had contacted a senior manager at CSIS was to discuss the means by which he would proceed with his lawsuit . 
despite what critics say , Canadians overwhelmingly believe in adherence to the Charter and its principles . 
honourable senators , the newspapers today reveal that the original Canadian flag - first hoisted aloft here on Parliament Hill in 1965 - has been found .

we agree that awareness is required .

privacy extends far beyond the provincial jurisdiction , particularly when one starts to use mechanisms of trade that go beyond the national scope and into a global scope . 
were it not for the battle waged by Conservative senators and courageous Liberal senators like Senator Anne Cools during the last parliament , we would not have had the review of the Divorce Act as it relates to child custody and access .

under the final agreement the Nisga ' a will own surface and subsurface resources on Nisga ' a lands and have a share of the salmon stocks in the Nass area wildlife harvest . 
Mr. Daniel Turp 
the situation is critical . 
Mr. Speaker , never before have the Espoirs de Laval so lived up to the hope expressed in their name . 
this is unacceptable . 
i have laid before honourable senators almost 50 judicial findings that the allegations were false . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 441 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
yours truly had proposed that the penalty that can be imposed by a financial institution be limited to three months interest .

a negative vote on Motion No. 105 requires the question to be put on Motions Nos. 106 and 107 . 
there are also environmental concerns . 
the salmon allocations contained in the final agreement are based on a percentage of the return to Canada , subject to a conservation limit and capped at higher run sizes . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
the proposed legislation very specifically outlines some of the factors that will be taken into account . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
agreed . 
federal government data suppliers ( i . e . , Revenue Canada and Citizenship and Immigration Canada ) will only pass information about individuals to Elections Canada with the consent of those individuals . 
when I was a little girl growing up in Barbados , I was taught to believe that , when all else failed , there was the right of appeal to the House of Lords .

Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :

there are numerous complaints about corruption in our foreign missions , and allegations regarding immigration fraud , money laundering and drug trafficking . 
there have been clear violations of the basic human rights and labour rights of nurses working in our country .

( division 104 ) 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
motion No. 266 negatived 
Mr. Speaker , a couple of weeks ago I was very pleased along with several of our partners , including the Canadian students association , the provincial and territorial ministers of education and the private sector , to launch the Can - Learn site . 
as all members are aware , we are joining with the government majority in supporting the Nisga ' a treaty , because we believe that it is only fair to do so . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am one of those , like Senator Nolin , who believes that . 
every party has indicated that they will be voting in favour of the treaty . 
some of them are women who pioneered in the workforce while raising families . 
some hon. members : 
the recent report of the cultural industry ' s sectoral advisory group on international trade presented the government with options for stepping outside of the current trade agreement and developing an international trading relationship for culture , standing outside the WTO and the NAFTA . 
some hon. members : 
the agriculture sectors that are in trouble are the ones which are dependent on export markets . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
on the Order : 
the Hamm government has employed new measures they hope will deter people from drinking and driving , thereby decreasing the number of senseless tragedies and protecting the safety of the people of Nova Scotia . 
the federal government would rather stay mute , turn a deaf ear and not take responsibility for a social problem that is all too real . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
all the bill does is assimilate relationships between people who are living together in similar circumstances to that of a heterosexual common law relationship and same sex couples who are living in the same relationship . 
obviously through unanimous consent we could revert back . 
lastly , I think Reformers have created quite a stir with the questions they chose to ask in the House of Commons about this event , because I believed that Canadians for the most part understand what happened when the students decided to confront the RCMP in order to grab the headlines . 
i recall joining a group of parliamentarians who were invited to Germany to discuss issues of nuclear non - proliferation and Canada ' s role .

senator Andreychuk : 
a . the extent , if any , to which Canada or British Columbia will provide to Nisga ' a Lisims Government or a Nisga ' a Village Government direct taxation authority over persons other than Nisga ' a citizens , on Nisga ' a Lands ; 
the U.S. anti - dumping laws also remain a crucial barrier to farmers in western Canada . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard 
honourable senators , in the course of six years in the Senate and 30 years in the House of Commons , I think that I have made my position on what Canada really is sufficiently clear . 
the eligibility criteria for new entrants and re - entrants to the labour force are different . 
my question is - 
( division 82 ) 
madam Speaker , it states very clearly in the Nisga ' a final agreement that the rights of Nisga ' a men and women are equal and protected under the law . 
bill C - 2 - Time Allocation Motion 
it says that participating states , those that signed the charter , including Canada : 
perhaps that was a different program , but we did not respond as rapidly as we should have to those kinds of details . 
members 
that is an indication of what was happening back then . 
why did the Prime Minister pressure the RCMP to compromise the legal rights of the protesters in order to protect the dictator Suharto ? 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
it is the agenda of ensuring that individuals are more important than states as we go into the 21 st century in a world in which borders and state sovereignty is being eroded in favour of individual protection and the need to ensure that everybody is guaranteed a better standard of living throughout the world . 
the expression clear question comes up no fewer than 18 times in the opinion , and clear majority 19 times . 
i first came to know Arnold personally in his role as returning officer for my constituency in the 1997 federal election . 
the Government will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach - by the end of the year 2000 - agreement on a five - year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country . 
i declare Motion No. 410 lost . 
as for the international community , I think this bill will be perceived as something very liberal and open regarding secession , which is not at all a popular concept around the world , so much so in fact that many very respectable democracies have declared themselves indivisible . 
what we really need is peace in the water and a timeframe in which to institute a regulatory plan to manage the fishery situation in a reasonable way . 
Clair has an active and vibrant francophone community to which I am proud to belong . 
time and time again we have been faced with cutbacks in funding and an approach on the part of the federal government to deregulate and offload wherever it can . 
most of all , there is the legal system , which allows criminals to laugh in everyone ' s face , because it is very permissive and full of loopholes . 
we all know that the decision in Delgamuukw supported and encouraged negotiated settlements as opposed to continued litigation . 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) : 
her husband has had the opportunity to go there but it is very expensive to run back and forth . 
since it was among the commitments made in the throne speech , Canada wanted a privacy act . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
there have been numerous resolutions from municipalities at the local level , as well as through the Federation of Canadian Municipalities . 
that story revolves around the fact that the RCMP and CSIS are having a turf war . 
we relinquish more and more of our sovereignty in international organizations and lose more and more of ourselves . 
Mr. Jerry Pickard : 
would the government be open to an amendment stating that the political actors in the determination of the question and the strength of the majority are the Parliament of Canada , which includes the Senate ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
madam Speaker , I agree with the hon. member from Sydney - Victoria . 
on the Order : 
committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Canadians and leading businesses are already working in their own communities to preserve the natural environment , pushing the frontiers and opportunities of environmental technologies and new eco - efficient practices . 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Health claims that genetically modified foods are absolutely safe . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 245 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
i can hardly wait for the next election , because then the people will have the opportunity to say exactly what they think about this government . 
the next question is on Motion No. 376 . 
complicating this balancing act is the need to account for the uniqueness of certain types of federal properties , as I mentioned a moment ago . 
by negotiating a partnership between two nations , between Canadians and the Nisga ' a , certainty has been created . 
will the names of violent and sexual assault criminals be published ? 
its only result will be to create privileged franchises for self - defined ethnic groups with questionable provenance , who already get excessive and unjustifiable special entitlements out of the public purse such as tax - free status . 
Mr. Bob Kilger 
there is an advisory panel that serves as a committee of appeal regarding payment disputes with crown corporations . 
hon. Herb Gray 
they are looking for some rules regarding expropriation to protect them in those kinds of investments . 
therefore , because the government is in a clear conflict of interest in this situation . 
we are a country with pristine landscapes from coast to coast that are vast , open territories , to say nothing about a variety of enhanced cultural benefits to the landscapes . 
she came up , he grabbed her by the arm , led her out the door , put her in the back seat of his car and with he and the officer in the front they drove off . 
i am told that the space station is the largest science and technology project in the history of humanity . 
Mr. Speaker , as far as I know , the meeting did not take place because the RCMP is carrying out investigation and has asked to continue its investigation itself . 
therefore I encourage our colleague to continue - 
what a shameful history . 
( division 468 ) 
can the minister explain why in May 1997 the Liberal member representing Vancouver East qualified for a TJF , and why two weeks later , after the federal election , there were no further funds to this riding , which is very poor compared to the minister ' s own riding which did get funds ? 
the Speaker : 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur 
for her to simply go ahead and take such action is mind boggling . 
hon. Alfonso Gagliano 
post - SECONDARY EDUCATION 
i believe that we will meet the OECD qualifications . 
however , we are informed that the increase is due to an increase in the cost of fuel , which I believe has gone up 100 per cent over the last number of months . 
too often these parties , and the Canadians who voted for them , are ignored by the traditional parties and the mainstream national media . 
Mr. Maurice Godin ( Ch â teauguay , BQ ) : 
this is of concern because Tom Bradley is , or was until recently , a senior member of the CSIS secretariat . 
senator Gustafson : 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
members 
that gag order introduced by the government House leader is unacceptable and all opposition parties condemned it at the time of the vote . 
it sends a very important message that impaired driving is an avoidable criminal act which carries unacceptable risks of injury and death .

Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
hon. Don Boudria : 
i want to share something that reinforces this fact . 
he follows in the great tradition of prairie social democrats such M. J . Coldwell , the second leader of the CCF in Canada ; Alf Gleave , a former national president of the Farmers Union and member of the House of Commons for six years ; and the honourable Chris Axworthy , attorney general and justice minister of the province of Saskatchewan , his immediate predecessor . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
that is the entire population of Canada today . 
men were out in trap - skiffs fishing , a primitive - looking eel trap was in place in the community pond , and the husband and wife who run a woods operation were hard at it . 
their recommendations begin to lay the basis for an effective family income security system and reasonable personal income tax rates for low - and medium - income Canadians . 
i believe the investigation is still going on and we should let the police do its job . 
these are very important issues , all of which can be dealt with through proper scientific research and proper health research .

i should tell you that in the 1980 s I started to write a book on Adam Smith , but what turned out was a second book on David Hume . 
has it led to peace , order , prosperity and good government for aboriginal people ? 
we will actually be able to demonstrate that we have much smaller numbers of people who require being in prison 20 years from now if we do the right thing now . 
Mr. Speaker , at the present time the people of this country are greatly concerned about their children ' s safety , having learned that the Supreme Court will not be hearing the case on child pornography until January 18 , 2000 . 
doctors do not function without nurses who are intimate participants in assisting the doctor .

i thought this would probably be the Senate ' s finest hour , the most important debate of my life . 
there are all kinds of legitimate initiatives but there are also a lot of scams out there . 
the federal excise tax is four cents per litre and that is applied directly to the farmer . 
the hon. member for Brandon - Souris . 
but at this point it appears there is not even enough to launch an inquiry under the code of conduct for lobbyists . 
that is something the Reform Party would do . 
the Canadian government cannot continue to do nothing on this issue until the protocol is ratified and implemented . 
after all , they were , and are , the closest government to the people in terms of delivering programs . 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
the list of generous contributors to the Liberal Party is really scandalous . 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
he stood in the House and told me no . 
i want the Nisga ' a to know we are going to be with them on their journey toward self - government because we in the Bloc Quebecois believe in it . 
the farmers have no way to pass on this cost or absorb that kind of expense . 
however , I shall now move to the other aspect of the Speech from the Throne that I wish to address , and that is , the reference to child custody and access issues . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe 
Mr. Speaker , I am afraid I cannot predict when the opposition will cause obstruction the next time . 
why did they not state the number that would be required ? 
why can this government not get emergency assistance to farmers who fell through the AIDA cracks , and do it before the end of October ? 
the reason it is more serious in western Canada is that Ontario has the GRIP which is still in place and is much richer than it ever was in western Canada . 
and by chance a certain priest was going down on that road , and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side . 
hon. Lucie P é pin :

this Liberal exercise cost taxpayers half a million dollars and was done without the approval of parents , school boards or provincial ministers of education .

madam Speaker , I think the hon. member answered his own question . 
Mr. Derek Lee 
they can talk about the muddy , ill timed , ill conceived bill they have foisted on the country , and hopefully the real issues of the country will go away , such as the problems in health care , the overburdened taxation system , the problems in education , crippling student debt , underfunding to the military and underfunding for the law enforcement agencies , all of which are not priorities .

when it comes to advocating something new to provide a way out of the constitutional box for either discontented federalists or for weary nationalists in Quebec , instead of presenting both plan A and plan B in balance so Quebecers understand all their options and the consequences of them , the Speech from the Throne contains no plan A and only a veiled reference to a plan B proposal for federal legislation on the secession referendum process and question .

Canadians beware , fairness can become what the government says is fair not what citizens agree is fair in free negotiations . 
the minister suggests they negotiate compromises to settle these issues , but rejects outright that non - status natives are covered by the treaty . 
what we have is a decision based on five members of the court ruling one way and two members of the court ruling the other . 
when I look at the track record of our three levels of government , I am always enthused and given hope that if they can keep their spending under control at the municipal level and continue to do the good job they are doing , why can we not do it at the two senior levels of government .

i agree that the issues being raised by the Quebec truckers are serious and ought to receive serious consideration by members .

oral Question Period 
Mr. Speaker , absolutely , Mr. von Finckenstein made a very impressive presentation and his report was excellent . 
in the worst case scenario , some people may be using the system to indulge in patronage , to buy from friends , from people who are helping the government stay in power . 
there are several conditions . 
politics aside , all governments , be it the government of Ralph Klein in Alberta , Lucien Bouchard in Quebec , or Mr. Tobin in Newfoundland , are wondering whether we have organized our health system for maximum efficiency and effectiveness , so that it can deliver the best possible services to the public . 
when he is released , he will probably be a much better criminal .

if someone is buying the guy who owns the calculator , then there will not be much of a debate . 
further , by paying down the debt at a relatively more accelerated pace , we lessen the vulnerability of our annual budget to the inevitable increases in interest rates . 
i think the member would agree with me , since we have both sat on committees for a number of years now , in some cases together and in some cases apart , that the Liberal government is not fundamentally interested in having committees decide anything . 
by keeping their traditions alive , fostering our present culture and wrapping it altogether in an attractive package , the members of the Club Italia choir showed us that diversity is the stuff that unites us and makes Canada strong . 
as a Canadian , I am pleased by that result and do not begrudge Mr. Martin any credit that comes his way .

if we look at the commitment to aboriginal health alone , we know that we have to do something about the doubled rate of low birth rate babies , five times the suicide rate and six times the death rate from injuries , violence and poisoning . 
he is a father , a son , a brother , an uncle , a husband , a grandfather , a colleague and a friend . 
i am proud to say our society has advanced beyond that stage . 
what is even more remarkable is that this vision arose in the midst of a cold war , a time when new space initiatives were routinely judged by their strategic benefits , not necessarily by their humanitarian and scientific attributes . 
why did it not follow the same trend as in British Columbia , where the legislature was to be involved in any amendments ? 
some came , like the last speaker , and quoted statistics , trying to convince us that it would be better under provincial jurisdiction . 
division No. 441 
Mr. Ren é Laurin ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
when we look at the heritage department and the way it blows hundreds of millions of dollars every year , the $ 500 million allocated to research sounds like a small amount of money . 
are we , in short , weakening the integrity of life , which , as legislators , we must uphold , through our legitimate desire to ease pain ? 
some hon. members : 
within the context of that document is , in my view , in our view and I think in the heart of the Prime Minister , the way to ensure that aboriginal and non - aboriginal people will come together , respecting their differences , ensuring that the respective cultures and languages will flourish and ensuring that all people in this beautiful country will be empowered to be the best they can become . 
tenth Anniversary of Pledge to Eradicate Child Poverty 
i remember that when we asked this individual , during Oral Question Period , to explain what was going on , he answered that 42 % of workers who contribute to EI are entitled to EI benefits .

the next question is on Motion No. 71 . 
no , Mr. Speaker . 
the credit for this reality is based on a vision that seeks to open doors of opportunity for our industry , scientists , astronauts and , above all , the future generations of Canadians . 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond - Guiral 
the government is still trying to establish national standards . 
the purpose of the Estimates is to present to Parliament the budgetary and non - budgetary expenditure proposals of the Government for the next fiscal year . 
yes , to 2001 . 
it is not only that the supreme court has told us that . 
Mr. Speaker , if that is the last question of the millennium for the hon. member , I am really wondering why he does not have anything else to ask . 
he knows something about the way Canada handles international treaties and the signing of international treaties and agreements . 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
he represented the Prime Minister at the conference to announce this very grant for this very hotel . 
it was particularly unfortunate that we missed an opportunity , as we were going into the university summer session , to hire and train young accounting students to help farmers with those forms .

the Speaker : 
his time should be more valuable than that . 
we all know that in the 19 th century , the people of Quebec were referred to as French Canadians . 
that might have created some of the difficulty .

like you , I am outraged . 
we feel it is very important , and I am sure the hon. member who asked the question will agree that the public should have a say in how these things function . 
it is a straightforward deduction . 
how can the minister justify the fact that the government ' s enormous surplus is made up of money from the middle class , which is the primary contributor in the reduction of the debt and in the payment of new expenditures the government intends to make ? 
i repeat , the two airlines got together to set the new pricing structure . 
why try to be divisive in the country and leave other people outside the fence ? 
in fact , the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs rejected it in December 1998 , and public opposition is growing . 
honourable senators , I only have information on the four patrol frigates to which the honourable senator referred . 
Mr. Jacques Saada 
i wish to inform the House that the party scheduled to propose a motion on the allotted day tomorrow has requested that the day be moved to Thursday . 
it did not hold any hope for farmers in western Canada . 
lower productivity means a less vibrant economy , higher long term and youth unemployment . 
on this side of the House we are getting tired of hearing that it feels good to know that Canada is the best country of the world , the government is letting it go to its head . 
more than one commentator in Alberta has recognized Ron ' s qualities and urged that they not be forgotten as a successor is being decided upon , confirmation that the stature and merit of our colleague is appreciated even in that province , which is the most critical of the Senate as an institution . 
Canadians are concerned that the courts are going to be dictating this legislation . 
this is the problem with the Liberal government . 
for six years the government has been talking about infrastructure , but rather than putting money into our transportation infrastructure it chose to put the money into such things as recreational facilities like bocce courts . 
our recruitment practices already comply with the provisions of the optional protocol . 
this legislation is something that the FCM has wanted since the arbitrary freeze and the 10 % reduction the Tories brought in in December 1992 . 
Mr. Speaker , I agree with the member opposite on one point and disagree with him on all the others . 
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau - Mirabel , BQ ) : 
the other person has had the opportunity to train and all the advantages that come with that . 
instead , this was the result of consultations and agreement among 33 of the 35 chiefs of the assembly of Atlantic Mi ' kmaq chiefs who agreed to voluntarily suspend their fishing to allow all parities to reach a negotiated settlement .

they were not . 
answer that question . 
i want the government to pay attention to the Chief Electoral Officer who is one of the best in the world . 
i would think the question is relevant . 
this country hardly ever resorts to referenda .

according to the Keystone Agricultural Producers who appeared before the Senate committee , a 3,000 - acre farm in Manitoba that had fuel costs of approximately $ 33,750 last year , will have costs of $ 47,250 this year .

in order for some communities to share in the blessings that this nation has , there is a need for basic infrastructure within a lot of small communities right across Canada . 
does that mean that they have changed their policy ? 
the departmental officials did not want to allow the grants , but in a memo to a departmental official one of the HRD minister ' s own staff instructed that the dollar amounts given to the two hotels in the Prime Minister ' s riding had to be artificially inflated . 
this bill is aimed at officially creating Canadian institutes of health research to organize , co - ordinate and fund health research at the federal level . 
honourable senators , it is not enough to clarify the legal context of medical decisions , far from it . 
but , the statistics show that the courts have never handed down a jail sentence of more than 10 years for the offence of impaired driving causing death . 
it is a sign of the ultimate decrepitness and decay taking place amongst things that the government ought to be interested in . 
we are already taking the necessary steps to make sure that we have a sustainable fishery on the west coast . 
efficacy of Programs for Problems Faced by Farmers 
Mr. Peter MacKay 
the Liberals have not seen the full light of day yet . 
sadly it showed a government with no ideas , no focus and no sense of how we move the country forward , only vague notions of what the future might look like . 
we placed child poverty among the high priorities in the Speech from the Throne .

government ORDERS 
what it does say is that , in order to be clear , a question must mean that Quebec would cease to be a part of Canada and would become an independent country . 
in that connection , I would draw His Honour ' s attention to motion number 22 standing in my name since November 24 , which is moving an instruction to the standing Senate committee . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i too am in favour of the 10 % rule , but I do not not want to see the government tie its hands so that we do not have some flexibility . 
i do not want to belabour this , but we have been in touch with the Hansard people and apparently the blues did come back with " taxes are going down '' . 
i am counting on the parliamentary secretary to put the glasses on issues rather than on political stripe and to try to help me .

i would like to thank the member for Surrey Central for seconding them and Louise Hayes for helping me with these motions . 
it seems important to me as well for us to always take this into account in our analysis grid when we consider a bill . 
from a Canadian perspective , Canada is not a large enough partner on its own to coerce change in a country ' s human rights practices through unilateral sanctions .

agreed .

the courts have studied many aspects of the Canada Elections Act in the context of various constitutional challenges . 
i have seen it done the other way and the results were not particularly acceptable . 
bearing in mind that , if the matter is in litigation or in the middle of a dispute settlement mechanism , the response may be very brief . 
the Speaker : 
it is the classic story of temporary and successive coalitions that manage to gain from power struggles . 
it would certainly bolster what has been said before in terms of being used , being levered for contributions to the Liberal Party and so on . 
if they are only here to support a position by a leader or by a dogma , and if they are not here to represent the people who elected them to be their voice in the House of Commons , then they should look inside themselves to see if they really belong here . 
prime Minister Trudeau was not one of the most loved in the West , as the leader knows , but he did come to Regina , Saskatchewan . He stood on the steps of the legislature , and the farmers were not very kind to him .

hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :

first , Bill C - 6 must include a clear definition of the information being accorded a right of privacy . 
it is not intended to be the only tool used to combat organized crime .

as a result the Liberal government asked John Fraser , a former Minister of Fisheries and Speaker of the House , to investigate the management system in place on the Fraser River . 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly , BQ ) : 
would the minister undertake to obtain an answer for us on the subject of cabotage issue by the time the Senate resumes next year ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am astounded to see that the members of the Reform Party are for the first time showing some interest for the French language . 
we are allowing one person to bid because they have already done their homework , they have already spent millions of dollars , and they already know how much and what limit they can reach . 
we have a clear notion of whom we are working for , unlike the Liberals . 
he told me to bid the exact amount I was being paid at the time and I would get it back for another five years .

hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 18 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( impaired driving causing death and other matters ) . 
what I am trying to get at is whether we should be ready , if not to deal with a matter , at least to take note of an initiative in Parliament before the Christmas recess . 
honourable senators , what is not before us in this point of order is the question of whether or not Senator Lynch - Staunton has a right to do what he is doing . 
in any event , I attended that particular event , and after one day they were asking me to join a political party or create a new one that was not the Bloc Qu é b é cois or the P é quistes . 
it will simply say that it is a crown corporation , not answerable to parliament and therefore does not have to reply . 
as to the best time to bring this issue forward publicly and give a clear government , no one time is preferable to another since the issue is not immediately before us .

government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
the Liberal House leader , who is ramming this legislation through the House today , in 1994 said : 
i personally applaud members of the House for passing this bill and the justice committee which put aside partisan politics and worked to improve the bill before us . 
some of my colleagues on the other side have already started to dismiss the role of the standing committee because they seem surprised that the minister , who wants transparency , openness and accountability , as everyone on this side of the House and I am sure on that side of the House would like to see , is willing to ensure that the questions which members might have - and I mean questions , not rhetoric - are put on the table .

the House leader for the government says that he needs a gag law because the parties and candidates have limits on what they can spend . 
we had some time to reply . 
logging 
it always finds a way to interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction . 
what a blatant double standard . 
the government bill , which is a copy of the one I submitted more or less in intent , went to committee and we effectively as a committee combined the best parts of both bills into the government bill . 
they are not up for discussion . 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
a ruling was made by our Speaker , and the matter was to be referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders . 
in the negotiations , the Nisga ' a were given rights to Gitanyow territory , to five fee simple pieces of land to the tune of a couple of hundred hectares as well as one island on Kwinageese Lake , which was part of the Gitxsan territory and the Delgamuukw designated area within the Gitxsan area . 
however , I thought the federal government would be falling all over itself to give money to the Ottawa Senators because giving money to people who make lots of money is not unusual for the federal Liberals . 
one proposal in particular would be to create a new criminal offence that would impose criminal liability on the directors or those responsible for failing to ensure that their corporation maintains an appropriate standard of occupational health and safety in the workplace . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer 
is the government not willing at least to analyse the results of its policies ? 
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) : 
i will now hear the member for Charlesbourg . 
the only people you have consistently consulted with are the persons who you deem to be leaders of the communities . 
it would be unthinkable for Ottawa to be the national capital and for only one of the two official languages to be spoken there , for French Canadians and other French - speaking Canadians not to be able to say that Ottawa was their capital as well . 
why was the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration not consulted ? 
this is why the Parliament of Canada , which has no interest in doing the groundwork for secession , would be better advised to confirm its disdain for such a possibility by formulating the only valid question and specifying what constitutes a clear majority in advance . 
madam Speaker , the second petition calls upon parliament to priorize funding for the national highway system in the 2000 budget to reduce fatalities and injuries on the roadways , to alleviate congestion , to lower vehicle operating costs , to reduce emissions , and to improve Canada ' s competitiveness , economic development and overall economic prosperity . 
bill C - 235 , however , proposes that action be taken before a divorce is granted . 
why is it that we have a virtual moratorium on building nuclear reactors in this country ? 
obviously this is not an ideal situation and does little to alleviate the problem . 
Mr. Peter Goldring 
i would urge all Canadians , as well as hon. members opposite , to get a copy of the citizens ' guide to the WTO . 
" 20.1 ( 1 ) On the expiration of five years after the coming into force of this Act , the provisions contained herein shall be referred to such committee of the House of Commons , as may be designated or established for that purpose . 
Mr. Mauril B é langer 
financing of Post - Secondary Education 
they cannot have all of these things at the same time , but that is exactly what this report attempts to do . 
bill C - 23 
many are , in essence , government companies . 
i believe it is very important that you indicate to us from the chair , in a clear and unambiguous manner , the extent of your attachment to freedom of expression and explain to us why the hon. member for Brome - Missisquoi has been refused the tabling of documents . 
new Democrats agree that a clear question is a necessary condition before any secession negotiations begin because with an ambiguous question it would be impossible to determine whether a referendum result truly reflected a desire to secede . 
this is an area where the federal government clearly intrudes into areas of provincial jurisdiction and it does it in devious ways . 
motion agreed to and report placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration later this day . 
i certainly assure him he will get the support from the Conservative Party of Canada . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
we will readily agree that millions of people have been killed all over the world in senseless conflicts since the end of the cold war . 
Mr. Speaker , our unemployment rate is down in spite of the policies of the government . 
i am pleased to see that , finally , the federal government is taking an interest in this matter . 
they should at least get to know the province and get to know that it is a large area . 
the committee may want to assess the extent to which the provisions are being used and their effectiveness . 
he was owed $ 18,000 in unused vacation pay , but after the taxman got hold of it , he was left with only $ 10,000 , $ 8,000 was ripped off by the taxman . 
HRDC is correcting its files and fixing everything it can find that is wrong . 
will the minister do the right thing now and invoke the notwithstanding clause ? 
from the town of Kirkland Lake : " I would like to express my support to the HRDC minister '' . 
i think it is important , especially during this week , to emphasize the risks and dangers of this horrible disease . 
it was the spirit of the need for haste which threw me off . 
we will complete the first round of training and make sure that by February our financial criteria are understood by all and that their responsibilities are understood . 
motion No. 16 
there are four main types of orphan clauses . 
criminal CODE 
the next question is on Motion No. 400 . 
as the bill clearly states , this Canadian Tourism Commission is a corporation . 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to rise in this House today to speak to Bill C - 222 , introduced by the hon. member for Wild Rose . 
- study harm reduction models adopted by other countries and determine if there is a need to implement them wholly or partially in Canada ; 
debate suspended . 
i wonder if , through you , we could request unanimous consent that the minister have questions posed to him by members of the opposition and his own government . 
for example , Calgarians send $ 300 million to Ottawa every year in gasoline taxes , but none of it comes back to pay for roads . 
would my hon. colleague not agree that the government must provide immediately the human and financial resources to help solve this problem ? 
( division 411 ) 
when we have a board of up to 26 people representing the industry from the private sector , some bureaucrats and so on , we have to wonder if it is the way to approach the situation . 
i know that Halifax , which was very much vying for superport designation , dealt with that in a very timely way . 
the exploitation we have fought for the past 200 years is now over , because , unlike industrial capitalism , financial capitalism means the exclusion of more individuals . 
why can he not fix the problem instead of trying to sweep farmers under the rug ? 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe 
hon. Andy Scott ( Fredericton , Lib . ) : 
this is a two tier pension system . 
foreign Affairs 
it means that cells are killed in the hair , the skin , and the linings of the stomach and the intestine . 
what about the property rights that the government has never recognized ? 
members 
Michelin employs thousands of Nova Scotians . 
motion No. 130 negatived 
madam Speaker , I have here a petition signed by constituents in my riding in support of Bill C - 309 , sponsored by my colleague , the hon. member for Louis - H é bert . 
the Speaker : 
i suggest that the member and his party go to the Canadian public and say that they intend to turn back the clock 25 years and get rid of all forms of common law relationships . 
hon. Andy Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Rural Development ) ( Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on the same point of order . 
if the Gitanyow and Gitxsan are acknowledged as First Nations , and if they are acknowledged to be in negotiations with the federal government , why should their rights be less than those of other First Nations , as would be the case if no further agreements are negotiated unless overlaps are resolved ? 
when one has a family - particularly a large one , which broadens one ' s expertise - one sees that no one child reacts the same way to a given situation .

Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comments made by the hon. member . 
i will not waste any time going through them because I think most people here know what true apartheid is . 
honourable senators , service to all Canadians has always been and will remain a central issue in the deliberations of both the Minister of Transport and the government . 
" appoint an advisory panel of one land surveyor who is a member of an accredited professional corporation and at least two " 
through omission , this booklet rewrites history . 
it is almost a dictatorship . 
Mr. Jim Gouk 
agreed . 
however , I do not believe that this is the wish of the Senate . 
i therefore take this opportunity to pay tribute to the extraordinary support foster families provide in our society . 
if this happens , it will leave unanswered all the issues for a comprehensive peace . 
6 ) Take international initiatives to ensure that international companies such as Monsanto are unable to obtain genetic patents in perpetuity on plant and animal life systems . 
it is not the first time a tragic oversight by the government has happened in arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada . 
the minister responsible for homelessness says that she is in charge of co - ordinating the efforts of her government with the municipalities and the provinces . 
this is why , on November 2 , I tabled once again before this house a motion calling for a special Senate committee to review Canada ' s anti - drug laws and policies .

i believe there is a large glimmer of hope .

absolutely not , Mr. Speaker . 
the new President , Abdoulaye Wade , whom I have known for some 25 years , was the leader of the opposition for all that time . 
most of the provinces with shipbuilding and repair interests have provided support . 
this might result in people being forced to have their relationship publicly known . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
hon. Senators : 
the minister will say that this new entity is at arm ' s length and he is not responsible . 
i would point out something that was said in the House by the previous speaker , and I am talking directly about that member . 
No. 
that is $ 60 million . 
i am fundamentally ashamed of that party and its lack of vision ... I 
Mr. Speaker , I think it should be stated here and now that those agreements which have been worked out with the federal government , the provincial governments and the producers are in place to help producers . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
it totally ignored it . 
yet the government finds $ 15,000 for year two of the continuous garbage project . 
we have made changes to ensure that . 
the board of directors recommended that when the specific mining operations then under way in Devco ' s Phalen mine were completed in about 15 to 24 months ' time , Phalen should be closed . 
to see what ethnic division could do - the mass killings and destruction of a people and a country . 
the government cut that discussion off last night so that we could not present a positive alternative or a critical but positive analysis of the Nisga ' a treaty . 
why is it that a deputy minister is calling us , that the minister does not know , that the Deputy Prime Minister does not know , and that the parliamentary secretary does not know ? 
a total of 1.9 million new jobs have been created in the past six years . 
that said , it does not mean doing nothing . 
i would agree completely . 
we want Quebec to be built , we want Canada to be built . 
this time Mr. Duhaime owes the federal government $ 66,000 in back taxes ; Revenue Quebec , $ 61,000 ; the town of Grand - M è re , $ 46,000 ; the city of Shawinigan , $ 15,000 ; and a local contractor , $ 80,000 . 
the Committee has two specific concerns that it wishes to see addressed . 
a clear majority has also been referred to in the bill . 
in conclusion , I would like to quote from Jean de La Fontaine , who wrote in one of his fables : 
as well , the Department of Foreign Affairs will be opening an office in Sudan ' s capital , Khartoum , with a view to more closely monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis . 
to this end , the minister asked the two Standing Committees on Transport to examine the question of the 10 % limit and , after consulting the main stakeholders and considering the future of the industry , to make recommendations on a possible change to this limit . 
however , I will tell you one thing : 
one fact that came out at that summit was the need to debate mobilization and getting more focused on the problems and challenges surrounding rural issues . 
with that , Mr. Speaker , I hope you agree with me that what we are seeing is a right wing agenda by the Minister of Finance implementing the policies of the Reform Party of Canada . 
the people of Quebec have the right to determine their own political future . 
recreational activities such as hockey , softball , 4 - H or scouts are all wonderful activities that come with a price . 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
information is certainly power in these instances . 
i sometimes find it useful to look into how misconceptions are created . 
this would allow senators the opportunity to ask questions about the wide range of matters that could be affected . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay 
so a big thank you to my colleagues in the GTA , in particular the member for Davenport for his statement and the member for Victoria , the Minister of the Environment , all those who attended the clean water summit of the Waterfront Regeneration Trust which focused on the moraine , the Geological Survey of Canada , and especially all the members of grassroots organizations who have given a great amount of time and energy to make sure that we recognize the importance of the Oak Ridges moraine . 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
respecting Aboriginal governance and , in particular , seek the comments of Aboriginal Peoples and of other interested parties on : 
this is their future that the government is playing with and we are not going to play its game . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
the question has to be on the idea that Quebec will not be a province of Canada . 
does it mean that all can participate and must do so to benefit from the exercise of that right , or does it mean that those who do participate must share the wealth with those who do not ? 
the Nisga ' a final agreement act states : 
the public ' s expectation of Oral Question Period is that it will gain a better understanding of how government and parliament operates . 
as clearly stated in the Speech from the Throne , our diversity is a source of strength and creativity , making us modern and forward looking . 
it must leap decades of economic development . 
that in relation to Bill C - 2 , an act respecting the election of members to the House of Commons , repealing other acts relating to elections and making consequential amendments to other acts , not more than one further sitting day shall be allotted to the consideration of the report stage of the bill and one sitting day shall be allotted to the third reading stage of the said bill and , fifteen minutes before the expiry of the time provided for government business on the day allotted to the consideration of the report stage and on the day allotted to the third reading stage of the said bill , any proceedings before the House shall be interrupted , if required for the purpose of this Order , and in turn every question necessary for the disposal of the stage of the bill then under consideration shall be put forthwith and successively without further debate or amendment . 
i was struck by the title of this article written by Jean - Jacques Samson , from Quebec City , with whom I do not always agree , but who really did put his finger on the problem . 
bill read first time . 
therefore , they are doing quite well in the cattle industry . 
Mr. Lynn Myers 
i think the hon. member has drawn out a very valid point about which we ourselves have concern . 
my bet is on wisdom . 
i am hopeful that that is the kind of commitment that we need in order to move this program forward . 
it is unfortunate because cynicism works into the hands of the government . 
question of Privilege 
the Speaker : 
motion No. 163 negatived 
it is a question of whether it will be clear about the question it puts before - 
and my predecessor , Rom é o LeBlanc , reinforced the central fact of French Canada across this country , culminating in the success of last month ' s Summit that put New Brunswick and Acadia at the centre of the map of francophone reality . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 433 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
the member mentioned broad based tax relief as though the government had actually delivered it . 
it could apply to anything at all , not just the tourist industry in particular . 
then the ministers who have them in their departments could be accountable to the people of Canada through the opposition , certainly through the official opposition , the Reform Party of Canada . 
as far as we are concerned , we have every intent to see this through and to ensure that this initiative benefits every region in the country , especially one of the greatest regions of Quebec , that of Saguenay - Lac - Saint - Jean . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
motion agreed to . 
paired 
the Speaker 
i should like to point out that his question and his allusion to me is mistaken and very wrong . 
i contend that if it were in Ontario or Quebec it would have been an entirely different story . 
as a former chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police , I can tell the House first hand that police services across our great country need parliament ' s assistance in this very important area . 
Mr. Speaker , the final petition I present today contains the names of hundreds of thousands of people from across the country calling on the government to immediately cut taxes by at least 25 % . 
No. 
some hon. members : 
that tells me that the government is under some obligation , whether through its own actions , in doing business or in providing for an authority with the ability to business such as an airport authority or a port corporation , to make payments in lieu of taxes or to provide to the municipality or to provincial government for expenses that may occur as a result of a particular business . 
No. 
it upsets and offends me . 
to ensure that intellectual property rights are protected , the agreement contains article 21 which states : 
it has to start covering a longer term , not just three years but over five years . 
some hon. members : 
they will add to our economy right away . 
hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the Government ) : 
for a considerable time during this voting the NDP have only had one or two members in the House . 
that Vote 5 a in the amount of $ 25,170,000 , under NATURAL RESOURCES - Grants and contributions , in the Supplementary Estimates ( A ) for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2000 , be concurred in . 
they want to take the divisive approach . 
that aspect of the bill is quite cleverly designed because it is built on the reasoning behind the development of section 745 and the amendments to section 745 contained in Bill C - 45 . 
bill C - 222 attacks band council administrative procedures head on , and by that very fact attacks their administrative ability . 
they are an integral part of our economy and the continental economy we have developed through the free trade agreement and NAFTA . 
there are currently laws in five U.S. states to prevent telemarketers from phoning people who do not want to be bothered .

according to some retired judges , if the law passed by this parliament is applied , this law will be disastrous for the 16 year investment , in Quebec , in an approach , a very Quebec model . 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research Bill 
members 
( the House divided on Motion No. 10 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
Dr. Polanyi made a very good point . 
i think that the wording of the hon. member ' s bill is appropriate . 
we will go to the daily routine of business . 
what we have right now are two fundamentally competing interests . 
when we look at our planet from space , I think it would give us a perspective on what is important down here . 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
honourable senators , I was born in Ottawa . 
these are the people who prevented us from holding discussions . 
clerk of the Senate 
the petitions are evidence of that . 
a company in British Columbia collecting information from customers in Manitoba may disclose it to another company in New Brunswick or New York . 
we put a vote to the House and asked at least to be given a referendum in British Columbia , one of the basic foundations of democratic principles . 
but , I repeat , Grit or Tory , the problem always remains the same . 
all of this is being done , as so much of what has been proposed in the MAI and now is being proposed at the WTO , in the name of creating new opportunities for Canadian companies and Canadian investors abroad . 
Mr. Speaker , let me say that it is the minister who has it all wrong . 
in the first phase , our committee had to recommend those structural changes in government arrangements to facilitate negotiation and implementation and to avoid costly legal disputes . 
yeas 
during the time allotted for the presentation of private members ' bills , a second item listed by the member for Wild Rose was inadvertently missed . 
i would suggest this goes back almost to the very beginning of this administration . 
the nature of our role in peacekeeping and peacemaking is changing . 
Mr. Preston Manning 
the practice of referring bills to committee prior to second reading frankly is nothing more than a way for the government to fast track legislation that it really does not want the public and the media to get a good handle on . 
that is positive step . 
motion No. 438 
Mr. Lucien Bouchard has said , and I agree , that as a result of the supreme court reference , " there is a duty on the federal government to negotiate secession , and that duty has constitutional status '' . 
the Royal Canadian Mint , Canada Post Corporation and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation should be added to schedule IV in order that they may be eligible to pay business occupancy payments in the municipalities where they reside . 
this goes back to last week , and I read from the Journals of the Senate of November 24 respecting the Senate ' s decision with regard to Bill S - 3 : 
Mr. Ren é Canuel 
social Affairs , Science and Technology 
yet the minister is just not able to do that , because it simply cannot be done . 
concurrence IN VOTE 25 A - INDUSTRY 
Mr. Speaker , the solicitor general did not really answer the main question from the member for Kootenay - Columbia . 
( a ) the Governor in Council is satisfied that Her Majesty in right of Canada has clear title to or an unencumbered right of ownership in the lands to be included in the marine conservation area - 
No. 
i support the amendment which would include self - employed people such as average ordinary Canadians when it comes to election expenses .

that the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word " That " and substituting the following therefor : 
some hon. members : 
Mr. Speaker , with leave of the House , I would like to table an article published in Le Devoir regarding Bill C - 20 , which reads as follows : 
in this case , in addition , a fund has been created where premiums are compulsory and the monopolistic investment agency becomes a major player in Canadian and foreign businesses . 
Mr. Speaker , I have acknowledged no such thing and it is not a template . 
some hon. members : 
i heard stories of nepotism , favouritism , the doling out of funds for things like housing and post - secondary education . 
members 
Mr. Speaker , when we clear all the rhetoric away from yesterday ' s throne speech what are we left with ? 
my concern in relation to this bill is that the government may lay down the rules for the various projects . 
the bill is a masterpiece of political ambiguity , and it is very difficult to determine if the Government of Canada knows exactly what its own real goal is with this bill . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
parents in many cases lack opportunity and adequate income levels and therefore children lack opportunities to pursue the types of self - actualization and important activities that can prevent them from pursuing crime . 
what month is it now ? 
if the hon. member is asking for concurrence in that report instead of tabling it , the answer is no , there is no consent . 
that same week a 21 year old Brampton , Ontario woman who was pulling out of a parking lot was killed by a drunk driver travelling at 140 kilometres an hour trying to evade police . 
government ORDERS 
enforcement officers may arrest without warrant and enter private property without permission . 
Mr. Speaker , the only ones who are asking for a stop to these programs are the hon. members in the loyal opposition . 
in the case of municipalities , they also assess charges for late payments , whether it is late payments for municipally owned utilities or whether it is late payments on property taxes . 
hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the Government ) : 
his argument was that the concept of privacy was altogether too vague . 
i would just say to the member that he did not see the regulations that we saw which would have made the changes . 
one of the most efficient lumber mills in western Canada had to tell over 100 employees they will soon be out of a job because the federal Liberal government negotiated a bad deal . 
at the reception the other evening , in the foyer of the Senate , fabulous and very valuable prizes were awarded . 
that is not a good enough answer . 
motion No. 57 
for all those individuals who vote against the mechanics getting a deduction for their tools , which is not that big of an amount , maybe they should leave the spark plugs out of their vehicles so they cannot come here to the House . 
motion No. 255 negatived 
that is what some people are tempted to say . 
as part of the Canadian equal opportunity strategy , we announced an additional investment of over $ 500 million for the purpose of creating Canadian institutes for health research . 
it is added to everything , even to the tax portion of that gasoline . 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) : 
i do not know which side of the coin I would ultimately favour in light of the new policy of human security that has been articulated by the minister responsible for external affairs and echoed by the Prime Minister . 
he does not like dedicated taxes . 
the petitioners ask our government to affirm that all Canadians are equal under all circumstances and without exception in the province of Quebec and throughout Canada . 
the B.C. Federation of Labour also said that it was especially important for the labour movement to discuss the Nisga ' a agreement everywhere it could since David Black who publishes 60 community newspapers in B.C. had given instructions to his editors to publish only editorials opposing the settlement . 
Mr. Speaker , the minister knows about this case . 
i am not a big fan of dedicated revenues but I think in this case it is correct . 
the Late J . Angus MacLean , P . C . 
i took the trouble to examine the history of this figure , and I discovered what I had suspected - that is , that this $ 42 billion to service the debt in the fiscal year beginning April 1 has not changed much in recent years . 
professors are proud of our involvement in the space station . 
in the February 22 issue of the Journal de Montr é al , we read that Claude Ryan would vote against the clarity bill , and he did not mince his words . 
maybe it is because the system is indeed unfair , but I would like to raise a point that makes it even more unfair . 
one needs to ask how one can best promote both the awareness of any particular disease or situation , and how one can best foster an environment both economically and academically to search for cures for these various diseases . 
i know that the people of Cape Breton have the resilience and the ability to deal with this matter and they have the resilience and the ability to change .

yes , we did make some cuts to health care in 1993 , but now the funding has been returned to health care in the year 2000 to what it was in 1993 . 
the Native Women ' s Association of Canada receives nowhere near the amount of funding that the Assembly of First Nations does . 
that Bill C - 2 be amended by deleting Clause 396 . 
No. 
the House can expect my eminent colleague , the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , to move a series of amendments to make this bill more acceptable . 
i must say that the same thought occurred to me and I wondered if I should not just rule the motion out of order , but I was afraid that doing such a thing would upset the chief opposition whip more than allowing the motion to proceed . 
in adhering to that procedure , Bill C - 20 follows carefully the direction , instruction and advice given by the Supreme Court . 
this is totally unacceptable . 
in that context , we have to be open to the idea of lowering the voting age . 
the House resumed from November 16 consideration of the motion that Bill C - 10 , an act to amend the Municipal Grants Act , be read the second time and referred to a standing committee .

point of order 
all too often , as it has done in the past and still does now , the federal government , with the best intentions in the world , decides it has exclusive knowledge and authority to put forward bills that have merit , but that do not meet the expectations and needs of the people concerned . 
as part of this work , it is the Government ' s objective to reach an agreement among governments by December 2000 on a national action plan to further support parents and families . 
it also applies to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province . 
the prebudget consultation process , above and beyond the OECD , has also been applauded by Canadians from coast to coast to coast as an innovative method of seeking public input . 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
in fact , when it comes to litigating and to enforcing rights of privacy , I wonder whether it would be possible at all for a person ' s interest to be at stake if that person is deceased . 
i declare Motion No. 183 lost . 
on one occasion the finance minister said that the ultimate goal was to lower taxes but - and unfortunately there is always a but - lowering taxes and reducing the fiscal load would not be possible . 
bill C - 23 would provide that in similar circumstances the surviving partner in a common law same sex relationship would qualify for the same benefits . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini è re , BQ ) : 
i speak out on behalf of the traditions , society and foundations we have in Canada . 
since 1995 out of 12 convictions for the crime of people smuggling in Canada , not one jail term was handed out . 
allow me to offer the best wishes of the Government , Parliament and people of Canada as you take the oath of office . 
what does the Prime Minister and the government have to say to Canadians about such a blatant misuse of their money ? 
i expect that there will be an opportunity some time for presentation of reports from committees . 
many expressions of gratitude have cited and continue to cite the devotion of this modest man , devotion that knows no bounds and that puts hope and dignity in the hearts of the abandoned people of society for whom he works so hard . 
associate Members : 
a few have chosen not to do that and have stayed in a communal lifestyle . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
it is one of those points that we cringe to recall , but it is real . 
it is tax grief for Canada , not tax relief . 
one young boy said " I will run out and find out . 
their loyalty has never been questioned either . 
agreed . 
certainly the mandate of these crown corporations has changed over the years since the Municipal Grants Act was last updated . 
on page 672 , Senator Angus said : 
the Prime Minister recently boasted about having surpluses and not knowing what to do with them . 
we have to get help from the Sept - Î les firefighters . 
nothing prevents the commission from broadening its mandate , if it were tempted to do so in the future , but for the time being it is not doing so . 
it is shameful that this is the policy of Canada . 
Mr. Speaker , I understand the Minister of the Environment has recently returned from Bonn and the council of parties negotiations on council change . 
senator Grafstein : 
the Government will also ensure that it has a modern and effective research and science capacity to promote the health , safety and economic well - being of Canadians . 
the government said " The committee will not travel '' .

as I pointed out in my questioning on the Sahtu , Gwich ' in , Sechelt and Yukon , some of those agreements were reached by the previous government and some have been concluded by the present government .

Mr. Speaker , I read with some disappointment the comments by the Reform Party health critic .

it is unfortunate that to this day we have not built the facilities needed to accommodate the families in their homes or to provide the schools to receive these children , a situation that has resulted in social dysfunction instead of the planned improvement in the lives of these women and their families .

short of going to court , the two governments had no ways of resolving this dispute .

the next question is on Motion No. 30 . Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the reality is that in this debate we have the absurd situation where three of the opposition parties are in total agreement with the government . 
i would not know if I was going to live or die because there was no co - operation on the part of the engineers , the politicians and the medical teams involved .

the motion was worded as follows : 
all the people who work around the Senate have been most helpful ; the Speaker , the officers at the Table , the general staff and , of course , our security constables .

while some of the provinces have amended their statutes , Canadians must remember that under the Constitution Act , 1867 legislative jurisdiction is divided between the Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures . 
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur 
hon. Lise Bacon : 
in the documents that Quebec and Newfoundland have signed in recent years , Premier Tobin has always insisted on having Newfoundland and Labrador , and Mr. Bouchard has always signed the documents . 
honourable senators , the Vice - president of Talisman has indicated that the company disagrees with the contention that Talisman is contributing to the problems in Sudan .

Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism . 
i urge all members to move forward so that at the end of this process we will have a new , even stronger Canada Elections Act . 
that is not a point of order .

the original land committee saw the death of many of its members over the next century only to be replaced by their chieftain heirs , their sons and their nephews . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :

as early as April 1999 the Mi ' kmaq implored governments to recognize , and I quote directly from a document dealing with the issue of the Mi ' kmaq fishery , that the impending decision from the Supreme Court of Canada in the Queen versus Donald Marshall , Jr. case had increased Mi ' kmaq expectations for greater access to the east coast fishery while at the same time creating uncertainty and anxiety within the existing industry . 
we see the head offices of industrial and corporate developments in Calgary , Toronto and Vancouver but they have no presence in the north . 
Mr. Speaker , I am glad to answer the question . 
the next question is on Motion No. 181 . 
the first has to do with the urgency surrounding this issue . 
this morning the government introduced a motion which will shut down the debate on the treaty at this stage by 6.30 p.m. , in less than an hour .

if the hon. member for Quebec East wishes to table the document , would the member ask for consent of the House and then we will get on with it ? 
i would suggest that this legislation still maintains a clear and distinct designation between married and unmarried relationships . 
let us talk about democracy . 
i asked the minister why , if he were legitimately concerned with conservation , he would allow anyone , native or non - native , to fish out of season . 
the hon. Minister of Natural Resources . 
senator Bolduc : 
third , the importance , as Sweden has demonstrated , of Holocaust and human rights education as an antidote to racism , xenophobia and hate . 
in a post - deficit time now more than ever , we need to revisit and eliminate bracket creep which has unfortunately brought more Canadians onto the tax rolls than we have ever had before and we need to revisit that , eliminate bracket creep and re - index tax brackets . 
since then we have added another $ 170 million so it is close to $ 1.1 billion . 
instead of pursuing its current policy , we therefore urge the government to do the following six things . 
hon. Robert D . Nault 
No. 
it is the foundation for our economic and social prosperity and our ability to compete in a global market . 
member FOR BROADVIEW - GREENWOOD 
he brags about 69 hours worth on something - 
i am pleased that the bill calls for a mandatory five year review as a means of judging the overall effectiveness of the legislation in practice . 
Mr. Preston Manning 
the Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire . 
on motion of Senator Kenny , debate adjourned . 
moreover , any Quebec business with a branch in another province - such as an insurance company - that is required to send it information gathered in Quebec would have to know whether to refer to the Quebec or the federal legislation on protection of that information .

the SENATE 
procedural authorities and constitutional experts support including Nisga ' a final agreement as the schedule to Bill C - 9 , an act to give effect to the Nisga ' a final agreement . 
just three or four years ago the number of users was only in the thousands . 
quite frankly , I do not think that the public has noticed that there is any huge problem with those privatizations . 
that this House regrets the failure of the government to recognize the importance of Canada ' s food industries : 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye 
incontinence AWARENESS MONTH 
that is a natural issue which happens . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member again for his question . 
he indicated that he was currently reviewing all grant programs in all departments . 
the speech is timid and lukewarm in terms of substance . 
members 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 365 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( definition of " child '' ) .

right Hon. Jean Chr é tien : 
the payment in lieu of tax system that was put in place leaves a lot of authority and discretion to the minister . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe 
for those honourable senators who do not know Regina , John Diefenbaker was asked by his campaign manager during the campaign of 1958 what should be done in the campaign in Regina , and he said , " Drop a bomb on it . " 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
this whole persistent determination to see good legislation brought forward to protect Canadians and the lives of Canadians by a member of the Reform Party reminds me of other pieces of legislation that this party has brought forward in the House and has caused changes to occur that have subsequently been adopted and championed as their own by the Liberal Party opposite . 
Mr. Keith Martin : 
some hon. members : 
hon. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
bill C - 4 . 
i remind the hon. members that the Chair will decide as appropriate how many points of order we will have . 
this is absurd and completely counterproductive to the whole notion of having an ethics watchdog . 
time will tell . 
a recorded division is deemed to have been requested on all votable motions and deferred . 
let me today acknowledge a company for which these are not just distant goals , a company for which these ideals are part of everyday reality . 
the survey also found that one out of four respondents said that government fees and penalties needed to be made more equitable . 
Mr. John Solomon 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
that the committee be permitted , notwithstanding usual practices , to deposit its report with the Clerk of the Senate , if the Senate is not then sitting ; and that the report be deemed to have been tabled in the Chamber . 
once again the taxpayers will pay for these court cases and really , for what ? 
Mr. Derek Lee :

when a citizen is under investigation in connection with an alleged infraction of a federal law , the attorney general concerned will have to obtain preauthorization from a judge , as is the case for an investigation within Canada . 
given our detailed and careful study , we were entitled to expect that the government would pay particular attention to the various recommendations formulated by the standing committee , but this did not seem to be entirely the case . 
( division 398 )

we deal with first nations in the country on a nation to nation basis . 
Mr. R é al M é nard 
northern IRELAND 
the Deputy Speaker : 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Ahuntsic , Lib . ) : 
i appreciate that there are other priorities that we should probably be dealing with . 
also today in the gallery we have a group of teachers from all parts of our country who are participating in the Fourth Annual Teachers ' Institute on Canadian Parliamentary Democracy . 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) : 
instead of the trade minister spending his time promoting his personal agenda , why is the Prime Minister not insisting that he show some intestinal fortitude and fight for our farmers ? 
why should they ? 
we say that we are the example of a democratic state . 
why does it not look at the reserves that are under its jurisdiction by virtue of the Indian Act ? 
that was always the type of conversation we had with Canadian . 
that Bill C - 2 , in Clause 398 , be amended by deleting lines 39 to 46 on page 161 and lines 1 to 10 on page 162 . 
motion No. 1 
hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) , with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58 ( 1 ) ( h ) , moved : 
unfortunately many people do not realize that the cost of the administration of justice falls to the provinces . 
that Vote 1 a in the amount of $ 3,821,100 , under FINANCE - Program expenditures , in the Supplementary Estimates ( A ) for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2000 , be concurred in . 
this is the problem that parliamentarians are too often confronted with : the excessive and systematic use of jail sentences . 
among other things , I do know that Montreal urban community police officers will be in Ottawa this Thursday to meet with officials from Canadian Heritage and National Revenue .

returning to the issue of the Farm Credit Corporation , will the government provide some relief to farm credit debt ? 
i have no problem with people who sit on the boards of large corporations being paid $ 1 million . 
private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS 
some Hon. Senators : 
i have listened to Reform members of parliament talk about how these changes will have a detrimental effect on the good people of British Columbia and on the Nisga ' a themselves . 
hon. St é phane Dion 
Mr. Guy St - Julien 
a recorded division on the motion stands deferred . 
in fact , it should closely question and monitor what is actually happening . 
we have a department called Indian Affairs and Northern Development that has been comfortable with identifying north of 60 as the north . 
let me just read about how seals are predators . 
it is because the agreement envisages member states agreeing that each of their criminal laws would have extraterritorial jurisdiction to the space station , including flights to and from the space station . 
the title is an interesting one . 
the operations and maintenance budget should be separated from the capital expenditure budget . 
motion No. 203 
in this country one of the things we take pride in is our freedom ; freedom from arbitrary arrest , freedom from arrest without the reading of rights and without knowing what we have done wrong . 
i sat down at dozens of kitchen tables with farm wives and husbands who were in tears and desperate . 
all it really says is that workers should be treated fairly . 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott : 
it is a prime example of how governments can work together for the good of all Canadians . 
the municipality cannot do that with the federal government . 
i mentioned earlier the CIHR . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
i can only say that Canadians are very fortunate that they had a government then which had vision and foresight . 
air INDUSTRY 
that is not to say that wealth distribution is not appropriate during a transition phase , but that is perhaps another debate for another day . 
Mr. Maurice Dumas 
members 
that is what is happening here in the House of Commons today . 
for all those significant changes it is important to underline that the major new directions to citizenship law that our government set out in 1998 are still valid . 
concurrence IN VOTE 5 A - AGRICULTURE AND AGRI - FOOD 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
does the hon. member see a growing sense of federal - provincial co - operation ? 
members 
i am encouraged that the government has recognized this as an area for change to produce a more democratic , better functioning electoral system . 
some hon. members : 
we have to separate that from what is truly in the interests of Canada and what is truly the route to a strengthened united Canada that is going to work better for all of our citizens . 
i thought we would work seriously . 
for instance , while Nisga ' a law - making powers over traffic control will apply to all residents of Nisga ' a land , Nisga ' a law - making authority in the areas of social services and adoption will only apply to Nisga ' a citizens . 
it is not an option for us but an obligation . 
if that contravenes the rules of this place , then I am sure that , as others have said , we are the masters of our own house , and can rectify the situation .

this is not a point of order , which is why I am interrupting . 
we are celebrating the lowest unemployment rate in Canada in almost two decades . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
coincidentally , in his submission to the Senate committee studying Bill C - 9 , the Nisga ' a bill , former justice Willard Estey pointed out the following : 
what we expect from the government is a fair settlement for the men , the families and the communities of Cape Breton Island . 
i saw men and women lining up down the street , with tears in their eyes , having the first opportunity to actually cast a ballot . 
Germany now has the third highest because it has reduced its corporate tax burden . 
for example , a couple of years ago , I remember that there was a dispute between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and local municipalities as to whether the department had to make a payment in lieu of taxes on wharves . 
a number of things must be developed further , in this regard . 
why has he decided that this has to be the place ?

the Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
perhaps I should call to his attention pages 21 and 22 where it says , " Canada ' s place in the world '' . 
No. Because his only talent was an ability to denigrate the Quebecers who elected him . 
while the Auditor General also noted that " projects were successfully implemented " , he also concluded that " better planning and analysis of options are required . " 
Mr. Denis Paradis 
does this not warrant more careful scrutiny ?

senator Boudreau : 
i attended in his beautifully panelled and sunlit corner office across the hall from the Senate chamber , now occupied by the current Leader of the Government in the Senate .

hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
as the WTO negotiations proceed the federal government will continue the partnership approach that led to the development of a unified national negotiation position by ensuring that industry and the provinces are consulted closely throughout the process . 
the only party saying that the process in place today is working is the federal government .

the Government of Quebec is absolutely free to ask any question it wants to Quebecers . 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I am pleased to present a petition today from Burnaby constituents who have been frustrated following the summer surge of boats containing Chinese migrants . 
i commend the member for asking me the question so that I could clearly indicate the intent of what I was trying to say . 
it has been neutralized that way and the next year one has to go back to the same company to buy seed again . 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i can tell her that I have been very careful with airplane conversations since my appointment . 
through its national assembly , Quebec had the power to determine the structure of its schools because , as far as I know , education is a provincial jurisdiction .

to offset the impact of inflation it will increase the threshold to $ 200 from the $ 100 level which was set in 1974 , the 75 % threshold for the political tax credit . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
it is difficult to answer that question briefly . 
i will address this issue as a Liberal should in light of their commitment to the Nisga ' a treaty and will discuss the issue of native involvement in the Canadian space station . 
i do not think we have ever seen in this country a provincial or a federal government , no matter what party runs it , that has not been totally enamoured with the idea that there should be more bureaucrats than actual operations . 
i want to review everything that has been said in here with regard to this question of either contempt or privilege . 
he is not a supporter of our party , the great Liberal Party of Canada .

Marshall Williams said " it made business sense that land on a major tourism route into Jasper be reclaimed and perhaps sold at a future date for a reasonable return '' . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
that will be considered by the shareholders of these companies . 
we are debating an issue that is very important to all the people of British Columbia and Canadians . 
yet if we talk about $ 800,000 to ALS victims and researchers , we shake our heads at it . 
that is what I am concerned about , because we are starting to see a few of those policies rear their ugly heads . 
Mr. Speaker , this week the minister sacrificed an awful lot of trees to show something that we already knew all too well , that she shovelled millions of dollars of public money out the door . 
sadly , this is often the case that we see again today in this country . 
[ editor ' s note : 
( a ) The fundamental principles on which Canada ' s publicly funded health care system is based ; 
i thank members of the House for supporting the bill . 
they are governments with land , with laws and with the ability to decide how they will educate their children and how they will carry on as a group and have community rights . 
they are getting fair payment . 
that is an even worse record , a milestone achieved much more quickly , than that of the Tories in a previous parliament . 
that is a very specific and derogatory term used during World War II toward people of German descent . 
if the government had shown any leadership at all , we would not be in the situation we are in tonight . 
what the member is contributing to the debate is very valuable and worthwhile because he is addressing the key issue of how this place can address that critical decision of the court and whether there is room for the government to manoeuvre on this issue , and manoeuvre it should for two very good reasons . 
debates of the Senate ( Hansard ) 
we have said that we needed community based solutions and we have been there encouraging that . 
in 1989 , 14 % of Canadian children lived in poverty . 
hon. Jane Stewart 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to table in the House an article from the newspaper Le Devoir of February 19 , 2000 , entitled " Partisan Politics and Federal Grants '' . 
there is no accountability . 
i would suggest that all members of the House read that very thoughtful speech and take to heart many of the points the member made . 
the opposition put forward a number of amendments to go ahead and hire people for various electoral offices based on merit . 
it makes cuts and crows about the money it is saving , but the provinces are stuck with the unenviable task of running programs on nothing . 
but to compete on an equal footing , we first had to restore the country ' s fiscal health . 
i have spoken with Val é rie myself , and she said she did not want imposed arbitration . 
some heterosexual couples are actually in loving , committed relationships and they do not have sexual relations . 
if the hon. member would put it in the context of the questions asked , he would see that the questions from his own party were in reference to specific projects .

nothing is possible without first attending to this deep wound , without ensuring that justice is done . 
madam Speaker , I apologize for referring to the absence of Reform members in the House .

remaining on the issue of finances , I would draw attention to clause 26 ( 1 ) ( f ) , whereby the CIHR may for the purpose of achieving its objective , license , assign , sell or otherwise make available any patent , copyright , industrial design , trademark , trade secret or other like property right held , controlled or administered by the CIHR . 
( response to question raised by Hon. No ë l A . Kinsella on February 15 , 2000 ) 
you are indicating that I have only six minutes left . 
when will the government start meeting our international obligations and make life better for children with disabilities ? 
it is a host of problems that have compounded and conspired to defeat the family farmer , whether it is world commodity prices or the corporate domination of the whole industry in terms of access to seeds . 
on the other , contributions were coming in . 
globalization , deregulation and environmental issues will also be on the agenda . 
will there be significantly more money put back into health care on Monday in the budget ? 
meanwhile , it has to be noted that this same government and this same minister did not lift a finger to help Air Canada , the more profitable of the two corporations , but the one that is unfortunate enough not to have friends in high places among the friends and the bagmen of the Liberal Party of Canada . 
first , we raised the child tax benefit last year . 
imagine what that did to the leaders of the municipalities across the country . 
the return of healthy government finances is now benefiting all of Canada . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
an ACT FOR THE RECOGNITION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS 
i know he has the support of a lot of advocacy groups that would like to see some changes made to the bill . 
for example , if the honourable senator ' s son is single with very few deductions , we can find out exactly what his tax savings will be for the calendar year 2001 . 
i see a quorum . 
besides this intrusion , this involvement of the House of Commons in the referendum campaign itself , we cannot help but recognise that clause 1 ( 4 ) of the bill limits the jurisdiction of the national assembly when it comes to determining the question to be asked Quebecers , since it excludes any mandate to negotiate or any reference to an economic or political agreement or partnership of any kind . 
we are thankful to the natives for their leadership and those who want to work with the government to find an adequate solution . 
without complicating the question too much , there is no doubt in my mind that I was seriously misled . 
some hon. members : 
we cannot just simply deal with the issues of the day , although we must and it is important . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron 
in the organization of the CIHR it was stated that 95 % of the moneys would be used for the hard edge of research and at a maximum 5 % of the money would be used for bureaucracy . 
turning to the agreement itself , it is important that I lay out the constitutional argument as I see it . 
the federal government has done much so far to hit hard at those criminals . 
we do not support that . 
sources of funding are being investigated within government , as well as from the private sector . 
i cannot imagine political representatives saying they would want to eliminate a people . 
we will examine the issue seriously in committee . 
there are less and less resources , money and effort going to our law enforcement community .

i was not always in the House when the Reform members addressed this issue , but whenever I was here , I was sorry to notice that they never talked about a very positive impact , which is the fact that we will be giving a nation the means to better control their development . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :

that is a very serious indictment .

Mr. Speaker , I remind the opposition and all Canadians that even prior to last year ' s budget in February the government announced $ 900 million and , along with the provincial contribution , $ 1.5 billion to assist producers who are under stress and need that help across Canada . 
we has been hard to provide training to new researchers . 
however , members will recall seeing the Queen , Mr. Trudeau and the current Prime Minister at this distressing historic signing ceremony . 
it is true that hon. members stopped being consulted during the election campaign . 
thank goodness we had bumper crops for many areas because they will help us get through this terrible dip . 
there is something that I am not convinced is in the bill and I have heard criticism in this regard . 
once again , I appeal to all hon. members that if they are on committees and there are reports , that if they have possession of these reports they should not be releasing them until the committee that they are with approves the report so that it can be released hopefully in the House , but at least not prematurely . 
no , there are no questions and comments for the first three speeches at third reading . 
i would like the member to address that point and to address the fact that it does not matter what we say or do in this place there is an obvious shortage of resources available when we are talking about correcting something that has gone wrong .

however , there is information , and I believe it is satisfactory , for honourable senators should they wish to have it . 
his conclusion was that the bill should be withdrawn .

instead of answering to the issue , you try to pretend the issue is something different . 
we can see from the massive cuts that have taken place in our health care system that we are now slowly moving toward a two - tier American style health system .

given the member ' s experience travelling in western Canada with the Liberal committee , does he believe that this committee should travel ? 
finally , the committee believes that , for the government to efficiently monitor the commitments that it would ask of the dominant carrier , the carrier should account for its operations through a public forum such as hearings held once a year by the Canada Transportation Agency , in cooperation with the Competition Bureau , and that the outcome of such hearings be referred to the House of Commons transport committee and the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications .

the Speaker : 
in each year since 1982 : ( a ) how many federal laws had their validity challenged in the courts for alleged violation of the charter of rights and freedoms ; ( b ) what were the names of each of these cases ; ( c ) in how many such cases did the party challenging the law receive funding through the federal court challenges program , and which cases were they ; ( d ) what was the outcome of each of these cases at all levels : trial , appeal and supreme court ; ( e ) what was the remedy utilized by the court in cases where the federal government lost its defence of the law ; and ( f ) in which of these cases did counsel representing Canada concede that there had been a breach of the charter ? 
that is the bottom line .

the Prime Minister insisted that the new armoury was necessary in 1997 when he was facing a tough election campaign . 
oh , oh . 
that might be administratively difficult , I acknowledge . 
but it is , because of what has transpired , not just over the past couple of weeks , but what has transpired over the past couple of months , a process that has been designed from the outset , Mr. Chairman , to cut people off from these negotiations .

Mr. Speaker , according to the papers , the government will be going ahead with a constitutional amendment with the province of Newfoundland to change the name of the province to Newfoundland and Labrador . 
i should like to thank him for giving me the opportunity to put that on the record because it had not occurred to me that this could be an issue in this case . 
they include , if I can just highlight , the treatment of non - aboriginals on aboriginal lands ; the fact that the treaty is one step away from giving taxing authority to the Nisga ' a and , in our experience , could very well mean taxation without representation and all of what that entails because of the lack of vote that non - aboriginals have in Indian government ; the lack of a timetable for this Nisga ' a self - sufficiency ; the open - ended financial commitment that all taxpayers are being asked to enter into and , of course , the constitutional level changes we are dealing with ... all of this process reminds me very much of the discussions around the Meech and Charlottetown accord . 
my hope is that we will spare no effort and not give in to blackmail and intimidation .

he said that we receive $ 3 billion more than what we pay each year ; this is simply not true . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
in a recent British Columbia Supreme Court decision , R . v. Bernier , the offender who was a party to a home invasion was sentenced to fourteen years in prison . 
they want the principles of the common sense revolution to be respected and implemented in Ottawa as well as Queen ' s Park . 
there is a magic in the air . 
one theme that keeps repeating itself and which is clearly emerging is the undemocratic nature in which the Liberal government is bent on ruling in this parliament . 
climate change and the increased storm severity and the damage that causes worldwide are a direct result of our economic activities in the world . 
the department will continue to argue before an adjudicator to detain when we believe the detention is warranted . 
" seeing as children and youth are our priority , the only responsible action in the federal budget is to make debt payment the top and only priority for surplus funds . 
let us look at what the Prime Minister said . 
we are in debate on a motion by the hon. member for Joliette . 
paired 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
is there unanimous consent of the House ? 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln 
it is not working toward our goal of ensuring the majority of Canadians have the opportunity to participate in the new economy .

we presume the provinces will maintain the 60:40 cost sharing arrangement on total safety net expenditures . 
we are early in the session , and it is the desire of leadership on this side to give fuller consideration than we have been able to give to the membership of the committees that the Committee of Selection will be striking . 
one would presume that a general study of fisheries from the perspective of government , would clearly have to include the Estimates . 
the Speaker 
paragraph 9 of the agreement ' s general provisions provides as follows : 
last year , in all the discussions about the bank mergers , why was the existing 10 % ownership rule enforced ? 
they helped me see that they were not competitors of Davie but partners fighting the same battle - to get the federal government to put together a real shipbuilding policy , a policy that would allow them to compete effectively with other shipbuilding yards in the world . 
Mr. Guy St - Julien 
throughout this country , we as politicians and members of parliament are held in low esteem regardless of this boondoggle . 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister has said that the Onex takeover of Air Canada is strictly a private sector issue . 
since the House does not sit in January , parliamentarians are really called upon to express their views on this bill at the very last minute . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the motion put forward by my colleague in the Bloc , the member for Verch è res - Les - Patriotes . 
some Hon. Senators : 
it gives structures for dispute mechanisms and an ongoing joint technical advisory committee . 
an improved highway system would also provide the important economic spinoff of increased commercial activity for business and increased tourism . 
we want to reduce those levels by 90 % by 2005 . 
we can do a great deal more in terms of educating people about the problem itself . 
yeas 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
many other countries have passed through inglorious episodes this century and , even after prodding , have chosen not to look back with such thoroughness . 
what is most important is that we look after the health and welfare of our troops . 
we should be talking about it , seeking input , and looking for ways to overcome the problem . 
the Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , the last group of petitions I have contains 203 signatures from Canadians from coast to coast . 
No. 
there were many compelling issues which it had to address . 
it shall be tabled before each House of Parliament within the first 15 days of sitting of each house and following its reception . 
Mr. Speaker , in other words , the government intends to cut off fair debate and deny the public the right to hear what is going on in the treaty . 
i rationalized my decision by telling myself that , as a professor of political science , it was my duty to undertake the campaign as a piece of academic research . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai 
those are British Columbia and Quebec . Both provinces are doing a good job of trying to keep up with the demand , but as the member outlined so well it is often the poor or single women or lone female heads of households who suffer the most . 
i am surprised he would be so mischievous . 
JOHN B . STEWART 
honourable senators , my first obligation is to sponsor this bill . 
Michel Tremblay , Denise Filiatrault , Ginette Reno , Louis Quillico , David Cronenberg and Mavor Moore . 
some hon. members : 
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. member for Saint - Maurice , I am very happy that the entrepreneurs in the riding are putting forward programs that qualify and that unemployment is going down . 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau : 
Mr. Speaker , the parliamentary secretary has already indicated that work is under way and ongoing . 
unfortunately , he is a minister . 
" force on July 1 , 2010 . " 
resource management is based on conservation and regulations . 
members 
it is a tribute to the hard work that there are not more complaints , given the complexity of the task of having people vote in a country as large as this . 
Ms. Val Meredith 
in other words , it remains perfectly legal for wealthy contributors to meet privately with government decision makers and arrange to make money available to a Liberal association in exchange for a favour . 
people spoke out very loudly against it . 
this bill is not about building offices . 
on the personal side , we need significant levels of tax reform . 
yesterday , the minister told the transport committee " Safety remains Transport Canada ' s top priority '' . 
if he has any precise accusations , he should make them and not try to use innuendo because he has no proof . 
i am certain there will be other desirable measures in the not too distant future . 
NISGA ' A NATION 
so , members should not be surprised if some people are rather angry . 
i asked the question : 
such things move me and now permit me , when I come to the bill , to say " This is not only beautiful country , there are fine people living there as well '' . 
( 2 ) The Minister shall cause a copy of the report referred to in subsection ( 1 ) to be laid before the House of Commons on any of the first fifteen days on which that House is sitting after the day on which the report is made . " 
Mr. Richard M. Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
i declare Motion No. 174 lost . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Bouchard has also said that the Government of Canada ' s willingness to have the supreme court ' s requirement for clarity respected is a sign of bad faith on our part and opens the door to a unilateral declaration of independence . 
senator Wilson : 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i would say , to the contrary , that in our last election platform and in our fiscal proposals of the past several years we have consistently supported increased funding for medical research and frontline real , hard scientific research , because we think that government is in a unique position to use public resources to finance the sort of research that would not otherwise be properly financed through the private sector . 
in that respect , the Canadian government has moved in the right direction with the AIDA package and the other assistance programs we have in place to reward farmers or food producers for saving their money and putting it aside for a rainy day . 
i would note that the department of human resources has a good record in responding to access to information requests . 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to address the third group of amendments on Bill C - 2 , the Canada Elections Act . 
prisons 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
whether the member will help us in that lobby is my question . 
should this be the case , I trust that members will remind the Minister of Justice that it is not in the interests of either Quebecers or Canadians to back such a reform , since it is not warranted by the present situation . 
hon. Lorna Milne , pursuant to notice of November 24 , 1999 , moved : 
No. 7 is to provide Canadians with a true non - news program . 
hon. Senators : 
my question is for the Minister of Finance . 
honourable senators , I have mentioned the cornerstone of the vision , our children and youth . 
that is the plan of the Reform Party . 
and Canada ' s ability to retain and build knowledge - intensive activities such as head office operations and research and development is being seriously challenged . 
it is the parents who support the family . 
i found the dictionary of Jacqueline Picoche here , in the Library of Parliament .

the Deputy Speaker : 
why do some of our young people have so much pent up anger and frustration that they would beat another child to death ?

the Deputy Speaker : 
many nights he would be sleeping at the foot of our bed . 
members 
is there unanimous consent ? 
i agree that homelessness is a serious problem . 
Mr. Stan Keyes 
it has been around since the dawn of time and is not likely to go away soon . 
i do not mean to imply the Nisga ' a leadership that negotiated this agreement has ulterior motives . 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale 
( the House divided on Motion No. 91 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to speak today to Bill C - 244 , the blood samples act , also known , for reasons I will get into shortly , as the good Samaritan ' s act . 
the existing industrial factory style approach underwritten by bad science and greed has taken us to where we are today . 
when they complete the investigation , I will receive a report . 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
sitting Suspended 
from the arguments that the senator raises , I gather that he would be opposed to the whole idea of a bill of this nature coming forward in any event . 
paired 
the motion suggests a national housing strategy . 
it is absolutely incredible that , today , the government is putting an emphasis on health . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier 
is it concerned with ongoing lawsuits or does it just want to wash its hands of the entire mess regardless of the effects on Cape Breton ? 
in addition , through Black Rod , I wish to pay tribute to her staff and the staff of the Senate who I know burned the midnight oil in looking after all the details and ensured that the functions were carried out in such an excellent manner . 
developing rural Canada and assisting rural Canadians will be a transparent process , one that is bottom up and not top down driven . 
i want to go further than that and indicate clearly how we would establish the business of becoming accountable and more equal in terms of the treatment of people , not only of Nisga ' a but of all people across Canada , in particular people of ethnic origin that might be called aboriginal . 
let us become more visible and more accessible . 
as we deal with this issue , I am certainly faced with one of those moments of very deep frustration and anger . 
it is commonly known that organized crime is actively involved in trafficking in illegal drugs . 
Tuesday , December 14 , 1999 
we look forward to working with her as this debate unfolds . 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
honourable senators will appreciate that I would not normally be aware of how the Inspector General for CSIS became aware of this matter or , indeed , SIRC . 
oh , oh . 
the farmers in my riding of Dauphin - Swan River and across the prairies face bankruptcy because of the government ' s lack of real solutions . 
the next question is on Motion No. 276 . 
i am hopeful that the House will also consider future changes to the criminal code in this particular area . 
i can only speculate on that . 
madam Speaker , the communal right is seen as a collective right . 
i thank the honourable senator for that question . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te 
- review the federal government ' s policy on illegal drugs in Canada , its effectiveness , and the extent to which it is fairly enforced ; 
he showed me all the papers of all the applications , rejections and the difficulty he had in getting the money . 
this is a very laborious exercise . 
but what does it matter , the framework agreement on social union , like the Constitution Act , 1982 , before it , which Quebecers objected to and continue to do so , is to structure Canada of tomorrow , to provide it with a national government , to focus on health care , post - secondary education and social services . 
surely this is something that could be useful . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 137 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
honourable senators , with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58 ( 1 ) ( g ) , I move that the report be placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration later this day . 
part 2 sets out a scheme by which requirements in federal statutes and regulations that assume the use of paper do not necessarily expressly permit the use of electronic technology , may be administered or complied with in the electronic environment . 
Mr. Speaker , we are not jeopardizing the lives of any pilots . 
then there is the Stoney Band in Alberta , where the chiefs and councillors received $ 1.4 million in salaries and benefits , ranging from about $ 65,000 to $ 160,000 per year . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 60 , which was agreed to on the following division : ) 
the minister wants to sidestep the proper role of parliament with the insertion of the Henry VIII clauses that allow cabinet to amend the act more or less at will . 
the vote that was held among some 2,500 Nisga ' a people living on reserve , with a very small minority of white people present , indicated that most of them supported the agreement that we are looking at today . 
as we know , there are in Canada 38 criminal biker gangs , one of which in particular , the Hell ' s Angels , is made up of less than 200 individuals in Canada , but has fifteen chapters , six of which are in Quebec . 
i am pleased to see the trucking and railway industries working together to ensure an efficient and safe transportation system that will continue to benefit local and national businesses and , in turn , keep our economy strong . 
hon. Robert D . Nault 
the next question is on Motion No. 5 . 
if we are serious about productivity , if we are serious about workers or profits due to productivity , the first place to clean up is the workplace . 
a negative vote on this motion requires the question to be put on Motions Nos. 114 and 115 . 
that includes many things from renewable energy production , to expansion of the University College of Cape Breton , to a national shipbuilding policy which the federal Liberal government has rejected over and over but which is a natural fit for Cape Breton . 
foreign Affairs 
however , I noticed that the Indian Claims Commission gave $ 638 to the Liberal Party . 
i declare Motion No. 264 lost . 
this is one of the main issues we have to address when dealing with youth crime . 
it would then be society ' s responsibility to support a child from a broken family or an abusive situation until he or she turns 18 years of age . 
we have a litany of suggestions and they are not being addressed . 
Mr. Speaker , if I understand what my colleague is saying , he would like Quebecers to be asked a question based on his perception of what we want to do , whereas we want to ask a question based on the perception Quebecers have of what we want to do . 
that is why he is suppressing debate . 
there is a theatre on the water shore there . 
if one looks back at Michael Starr ' s life history in cabinet and in the Parliament of Canada , one will find that the work he did in the field of labour remains a monument and a useful source of reference for those trying to work their way through labour law . 
we mentioned some ridings , but there are other Liberal MPs in Quebec . 
it is essential the government open up the process of divesting itself of Devco . 
canada - Europe Parliamentary Association 
it is pulling the strings of its members and getting them to vote the way they are told on all sorts of issues . 
it is not something that is theoretically being apprehended , which was the decision of the government when it invoked section 47 . 
the vote must faithfully reflect the will of the voters to have their province cease to be a part of Canada . 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member knows very well that in the last 12 months the federal government has put forward nearly $ 1.1 billion as well as made a number of changes to existing safety net programs . 
while I support the bill , I will remind the House that the root of our problems in many sectors , such as shipbuilding , comes from our decreased ability to use subsidies and tax incentives to promote domestic economic development . 
with the input of first nations , this process has the potential to help first nations people assume greater responsibility and accountability for their actions . 
senator Boudreau : 
and the bells having rung : 
unlike normal plants it cannot reproduce itself . 
honourable senators , I have a great deal of concern about several aspects of this bill . 
Horton ( 4 ) - Groundfish , Lobster ( 2 ) , Mackerel 
most of the laws focus on punishment for crimes committed and are often too late for victims . 
we have 500,000 citizens who have said " Do something '' , but the government does not do a thing . 
in the last session of Parliament , the House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry carried out an extensive study of the predecessor bill , Bill C - 54 . 
Mr. Speaker , the government is very concerned about child poverty . 
our government ' s commitment to improve the quality of life of Canadians says it all . 
century farms are going bankrupt . 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to support the government and the Minister of Canadian Heritage on continuing investment in the arts and cultural industries in our country . 
we must remember also that he has a limited budget . 
hon. Anne C . Cools :

motion No. 11 
when will we get the project office open , and when will we give the military an indication that it is now time for the Government of Canada to replace the Sea King helicopters ? 
petitions 
Mr. Speaker , a very serious issue is weighing heavily on the minds of the Liberals . 
if one were to review the debate on March 3 , one could see that Senator Stewart and Senator Comeau put those requests forth . 
those small communities will be looked after under the legislation . 
the hon. minister of Indian affairs . 
obviously , you cannot consider right away what will be asked as a substantive motion , but you must at least listen to what the hon. member has to say in order to be able to establish whether or not it is a substantive motion . 
it is critical and it needs dealing with . 
Mr. Speaker , if Quebecers want a clear question and if they are saying that the question asked in 1995 was not clear , it means that they have a sense of logic . 
while I would like to applaud the federal government for taking bold leadership on this issue , unfortunately I cannot do so . 
despite the Golden report , the report of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities , the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association , my own report from my travels across Canada this winter , the report of the Toronto Disaster Relief Committee , CMHC itself , and so on , we are still living with the terrible record of being the only industrialized country without a national housing strategy . 
some 40 per cent of the population of the new town would be English - speaking , which would cause them to lose their bilingual status . 
i see the hon. Deputy Prime Minister on his feet . 
the federal government has given itself every power . 
why on earth did the government not just accept this compromise in this area in particular ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
the former things that we were able to debate and decide and on which governments were able to change their minds as we got new governments or as governments themselves changed their minds , are all things that are no longer possible .

government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
with such an important piece of legislation it is significant that the government decided to direct its passage through parliament by way of the more unorthodox method of proceeding directly to committee before second reading . 
there has been a dearth of ideas across the floor on what members of the opposition would do if they had the financial resources that are being made available in this case . 
Mr. R é al M é nard 
hon. St é phane Dion 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) :

Mr. Yves Rocheleau 
after six months he is still waiting for proper diagnosis . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
the parliamentary secretary who responded made reference to the absence of a member during committee this morning . 
honourable senators , my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
it should be emphasized that the Government of Canada has always stated throughout this process that particular attention should be given to ensuring that producers share in the benefits resulting from a more commercial and competitive system . 
Mr. Speaker , further to the tabling by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs of a bill denying the basic rights of Quebecers , I seek the unanimous consent of the House to table a document that could enlighten the House .

however , a number of witnesses testified before the committee that doctors are often reluctant to provide sufficient pain control medication to alleviate suffering if there is a possibility that it may shorten the life of patients , for fear that the doctor might be held criminally liable . 
perhaps it can rethink that one before the estimates come before the House next month .

what could the member say to the government to convince it to listen up , to open its heart and to help the poor in our regions ? 
a policy has been announced . 
however , the drastic cuts in transfers to the provinces by the federal government have had compelled Quebec to share the financial consequences with the municipalities , in addition to putting the health care and education systems in jeopardy . 
we must remember that taxing something effectively means that we get less of it . 
that is probably true . 
is there unanimous consent to proceed in this manner ? 
if the Liberals will not move forward and make positive changes , we will certainly work hard to form the government to make the changes necessary to set the country back on its feet again with a positive , forward moving vision . 
it directed attention to the basic point that complex social problems require complex solutions which need complex evidence . 
when did he find out ? 
however , we withhold support when Quebec ' s interests are at stake and must be defended , when we must ensure that all Quebecers are covered by legislation . 
senator Austin : 
is marriage really that fragile ? 
an hon. member : 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
does that not show , therefore , that trade is of paramountcy and not human rights ? 
i know exactly what they are going to say now , " How about the western farmers ? " 
( the House divided on Motion No. 83 , which was agreed to on the following division : ) 
36 th Parliament , 2 nd Session 
it can run anything it wants . 
thousands are brought in , as people are being constantly reminded through the daily media . 
i ask the Prime Minister again , why does he not ask the supreme court for a stay of this judgment and why does he not come up with a fishery policy that recognizes equality under the law not special entitlement simply based on race ? 
at best , it is a wholly dependent contractor . 
it is about obligations and benefits . 
this past weekend we saw the result of that bullheadedness . 
we are trying to put in place not the decision , not the end point , but the structure within which we have the discussion , something that is extremely difficult to do , to talk about the breakup of our country . 
obviously we will not be eating or drinking . 
we have tried to work together . 
that is a handout of $ 101,200 in tax dollars to every one of the 2,500 members of the band and title to a land mass just slightly smaller than the country of Luxembourg . 
these principles are : federalism , democracy , constitutionality and the rule of law , and protection of minorities . 
the next question is on Motion No. 128 . 
motion No. 464 
many of my constituents have received benefits from the $ 1 billion endowment to the Canada Foundation for Innovation which is helping to build a leading edge national system of innovation . 
Canadian authorities should therefore have obtained a warrant before sending the letter of request to the Swiss authorities . 
current FTEEC program assignment are identified above in item ( e ) . 
in 1973 , he was the first to succeed in making any progress toward recognition of ancestral and aboriginal rights . 
young Canadians are back at work . 
there have been many more like Mr. Barton with whom I have met face to face . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. John Harvard 
considering that the public is opposed to importing plutonium , what is the Minister of the Environment waiting for to demand that his government at least comply with the process it set up itself ? 
Mr. Rick Casson 
now we have a bill . 
this is simply an appeal to the hon. member to withdraw those words and then I will hear whatever the hon. member has to say . 
i want to specifically say that I am not taking sides . 
i am separated from my wife and have been for over two years . 
this does not work . 
each Heritage Day celebrates a different aspect of the places , people and events which have helped to shape our country . 
on motion of Senator Bacon , report placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration at the next sitting of the Senate . 
i expressed some concerns about the image of the Senate as it was , at that particular time , in the midst of some terrible publicity . 
the Speaker : 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the sale of the Prince mine in Cape Breton and the possible development of the Donkin site could provide employment opportunities . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
members across may scoff at this , but if this were not true , why did such an amendment pass the committee last week ? 
this is from the minister . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
we heard from educators , health care workers , economists and individual municipalities . 
equality 
( the sitting of the House was suspended at 6.14 p.m. ) 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
it is fitting , I suppose , that we mark his passing at a time when a federal byelection is under way to fill a vacancy in the House for the very riding which he once represented . 
i declare Motion No. 72 carried . 
madam Speaker , it says the " jurisdiction in the areas of labour law and transportation law '' . 
i know that the government finds this annoying , but that would have been possible , right ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
it would also be helpful to have the minister set out his plan to achieve virtual elimination . 
the supreme court deliberated on the bill for quite some time and came down with a decision that the bill , if I remember correctly , was legal in terms of the constitutional changes but did not follow proper convention or practice in terms of the constitution of the country . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
hon. Robert D . Nault 
orders OF THE DAY 
in addition to the Cormorant , the minister has announced the beginning of modernization of programs for both the Aurora maritime patrol aircraft and the CF - 18 aircraft . 
therefore , Mr. Speaker , I urge that you grant the emergency debate because this did come from parliament and from all of us working together . 
each year , six artists are nominated for the awards by members of their own arts community . 
there were the initial reactions . 
order , please . 
before discussing the motion , however , I want to take a moment to set the issue in context . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
in my view what we are seeing is hopeless homophobia on the part of certain members who are colouring their positions or changing them . 
this is recognized in international law . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am told - and correct me if I am wrong - that a few subjects that are concurrent with paramountcy are neither federal nor provincial , in which case it may be that there is a cloud somewhere in the agreement . 
we also had to deal with an economy at a time when jobs were being lost . 
however , in matters as important as marine conservation , I would hope that the government would forgo its usual policies of sleight of hand legislation and instead adopt due process . 
the next question is on Motion No. 276 . 
they travelled all the way here and went back empty handed . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator Nolin , debate adjourned . 
the treaty is not about establishing a separate solitude for the Nisga ' a as some Reform Party members insist . 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
nineteen out of twenty in Ontario , and only one out of twenty in Quebec , and every six months , somebody talks about closing it . 
only a very select group of people were allowed to appear before that committee . 
the response that we have had to this crisis from the Liberal government has been the AIDA program . 
honourable senators , this is an issue which will require a frank discussion between the Prime Minister and the Premier of Ontario . 
that Bill C - 6 be amended by deleting Clause 4.9.1 of Schedule 1 . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the Government will give increased prominence to human security in its foreign policy , working to achieve meaningful progress in the councils of the world on a global human security agenda . 
i made a speech on the great qualifications of Mr. Bruce Phillips years ago . 
i was at the meeting in Yarmouth . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
is leave granted ? 
the Senate met at 1:30 p.m. , the Speaker in the Chair . 
agreed . 
i would put to the hon. member that there is never a situation when 100 per cent of the applications for anything , whether it be this type of program or any type of program , have been accepted . 
that particular clause was not challenged seriously until World War II when a black gentleman from Winnipeg challenged the act . 
this is unfortunate , because the government will be missing an opportunity to show how effective the current legislation is and to distance itself from the demagogic policies of the Reform Party . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
the government has been asked by the province of Nova Scotia to deal with this . 
it was asking for some action to be taken last week by the federal government in terms of the Vancouver port situation . 
the Government of Ontario came before the committee to express their reservations about various aspects of the bill , but the officials declined to express a view or to state that there is an Ontario view as to the constitutionality of the bill . 
we have had the biggest cutbacks in health care in the history of the country . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 417 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
that was not a bill . 
( division 78 ) 
today in committee I made the commitment to work with members of parliament to ensure that they get the information they want through their local human resources development branch office . 
i am certainly supportive of the senator ' s views , and whenever the opportunity arises , I make that same point . 
* * * 
paired 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron 
however , the immediate issue , separate from the larger issue , is whether or not Senator Robichaud ' s committee , Fisheries and Oceans , can have those particular votes for study . 
honourable senators , is it your pleasure to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard 
we have been presenting it as a pan - Canadian initiative . 
that is not even a drop in the bucket of funds needed to upgrade Highway 101 . 
in theory , this gives many people an equal opportunity . 
notwithstanding that somewhat dilatory point of order , I think he made a very important intervention . 
i think former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau would be very surprised at what is happening in this bill . 
i alluded yesterday to the testimony of a lawyer by the name of Ian Lawson from British Columbia , who is an expert in privacy law , and a relative of our colleague Senator Kelly , I may say en passant . 
the audit did not measure the results of these programs . 
bill C - 2 falls short in many different ways . 
our existing safety nets and now AIDA will help ensure it stays that way . 
first REPORT 
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) : 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
... are not simply " descriptive " of rights . 
the Prime Minister ' s response was that he had indeed received $ 100 million over so many years . 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but his time is up . 
there is a link between Bre - X and the Reform Party . 
we take no joy in it . 
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the hon. member ' s comments particularly with regard to the lack of substance in the throne speech . 
motion No. 330 negatived 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
almost every other matter has had a committee travel the country to ask Canadians what they think about that particular matter . 
i was just an ordinary Canadian then and I still am . 
Mr. Lawrence D . O ' Brien ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
for each of the fiscal years from 1994 to 1998 inclusively , and with respect to French language broadcasting stations operating outside Quebec and English language broadcasting stations operating within Quebec , what has the government determined to be : ( a ) the total amount of federal tax dollars spent in each province to provide these services ; and ( b ) the total amount of advertising revenue generated by each of these stations ? 
diabetes 
there must be some investments in garages if we want mechanics to be employed . 
currently , that is how the Senate apparently exercises a supervisory role over constitutional negotiations by the executive . 
let us talk about the requirements for registered party status . 
this is a debate that gets a lot of reactions here . 
since that time , I have had a number of indignant - indeed , in some cases irate - letters from various people , notably those interested in genealogy . 
it is going to drag on for months and months . 
the only people who may have access to the results of the blood test are a peace officer , the medical practitioner , the applicant and the person from whom the sample of blood was taken . 
in Saskatchewan alone the number is at least $ 1 billion . 
the committee ' s report , entitled " Budget 2000 - New Era - New Plan '' , is the result of our continuing conversations with Canadians , a national dialogue that has helped us to understand our fellow citizens ' values and priorities and how the federal budget should reflect them . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
oversight will be complaints driven , but the Privacy Commissioner has been given a strong public education and advisory role . 
they have to take some responsibility for that management . 
Mr. Jerry Pickard 
he is so opposed to some parts of the legislation that he has put forward a number of amendments . 
my confidence is shaken because , in the legislative process , particularly with regard to confidentiality , most of us wanted the system to work and cooperated to that end . 
the honourable senator is entitled to his opinion . 
the government stands firmly against child pornography . 
i think this has some good , sound , scientific basis . 
* * * 
that is the mission of Transport Canada . 
we are providing good services now but we want to do much better in the near future . 
let us let the commissioner make these decisions . 
the Quebec Civil Code has always recognized these rights . 
i am saying that because of this country ' s political tolerance the best view of Canada is from Quebec . 
this bill is intended to serve such a purpose , that is , to stimulate debate and to come up with solutions other than the one proposed in the bill , if so desired . 
it should be noted that the MRC has , in fact , already undertaken to perform some of these additional powers and functions on its own ; however , the remaining powers and functions would set the CIHR apart from the MRC . 
if it was at least a party that knew what its name was , we could have a serious debate . 
the question is on the amendment . 
hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
that is why we have made the youth employment strategy a permanent program . 
we made a mistake helping his people . 
genetic ENGINEERING 
Mr. Mauril B é langer ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
organizations such as the YWCA provide programs teaching men and women to express their feelings in a productive manner . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
it is important that we express that view , and I think it is the opinion of the Prime Minister that that view must be expressed . 
i also wish to add a special thanks on behalf of the committee to Senators Grafstein , Lawson , Sparrow and Tkachuk who , while not permanent members of the committee , attended and participated as if they were . 
the standing orders give the chair some discretion . 
hon. Paul Martin 
they were asking the federal government to take the initiative in protecting the things they value most as Canadians : access to shelter , a quality health care system , employment , and protection of the environment for future generations . 
the reason I say that is because we are already overgoverned in this country . 
the parents were quite concerned . 
what I want , and this is why I seek the unanimous consent of the House , is for Quebec to be allowed to continue to proceed in its own way , and the rest of Canada to do as it pleases . 
clowns AND SANTAS 
that program was in existence before the Marshall decision and is almost guaranteed to continue in some form . 
of course the government is saying certain things . 
No. 
we have to wait . 
where did those numbers come from ? 
last year , the government turned down the proposed merger of Canada ' s leading banks . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
significant dollars were in question when she was in the aboriginal affairs department . 
it has to be the laziest government in this century .

Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
and that is exactly what is happening . 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise to reintroduce this bill . 
the hon. member is therefore very familiar with the whole structure of the Criminal Code . 
first , we are pleased to see that third party spending limits have been reintroduced to the $ 150,000 maximum , with no more than $ 3,000 against the individual candidate . 
as well , it increased the provincial excise tax on gasoline twice , taking it from 11.3 cents to 14.7 cents . 
the democracy and transparency that the Liberal Party is talking about is to help these people . 
we would like the reimbursement of campaign finances removed . 
Mr. Speaker , is that not interesting ? 
the city of Quesnel is proud to host the year 2000 winter games . 
that came about as a direct result of the aboriginal fishing policy and the commercial fishing regulations which were put in place by the government . 
hon. St é phane Dion 
madam Speaker , I am happy to rise today to speak to Bill C - 13 , a bill to establish the Canadian institutes of health research . 
to that extent , it would be desirable to hold discussions with and hear testimony from provincial government ministers and officials . 
... must be measured against the " minority protection " benchmark , one of the fundamental organizing principles of the constitution . 
but where are the Liberals ? 
i should like the honourable senator to know that I am in favour of a floating exchange rate . 
madam Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for her very thoughtful question . 
can it be made with interest if it is on an annual instalment ?

what reasonable person could expect that a law like this one would take seven years to come to a conclusion ? 
we have access to information requests which detail that not only did the officials in the HRD department have to inflate job costs , they had to depart from the guidelines . 
Mr. Peter MacKay 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
hon. Don Boudria 
no one in this chamber would dare challenge it . 
this House is not a democracy , it is anything but . 
i want to ask my Reform colleague if he also believes that the transport minister has put his cards on the table and is not on the payroll of Onex . 
take the situation here in the House of Commons , where there are sovereignists , good Canadians in my view , separatists , also good Canadians in my view , and supporters of independence , good Canadians as well , because here in this country we can debate the most delicate of political topics . 
i would just like to remind him that he is in a federal parliament not in a provincial legislature talking about provincial issues . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 6 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
i would have liked the member to recognize that , if he wants to talk about Canada ' s democratic tradition , he must talk about APEC and about the action taken by the Prime Minister when he himself assaulted a protester here , on Parliament Hill . 
the idea that all such persons are reluctant to give such details because of refugee - based fears , or that the persons helping them enter Canada are latter - day Raoul Wallenbergs , is naive . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
what I find appalling is that he obviously stooped to those types of tactics just so he could come into this place , stand before the television cameras and brag about how he gave up five minutes of his time . 
i am confident we will have a resolution to this problem very quickly . 
with no budget for the coast guard , deep cuts to the RCMP and sparse navy patrol on the water to intercept these vessels , Canadian coastlines are vulnerable . 
Mr. Speaker , I have a point of order . 
an opposition day motion was passed in the House with support from all political parties which ensured that the current definition of marriage would be retained , yet the government has not seen fit to have that included in this new act . 
naturally , however , I want to begin by thanking my constituents in Saint - Lambert , to whom I owe the great privilege of sitting in this place . 
Canadians told us that they did not want treaty lands to be separate from the rest of Canada . 
those of us who are working with community based policing know full well the importance of getting out into the community , especially with respect to young people , to ensure that we deal with them in an effective and meaningful way . 
these were her words : 
No. 
federal , provincial and territorial governments are developing together the National Children ' s Agenda . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
as Senator Cohen knows well , it is now November of 1999 and , sadly , we are actually further behind than we were in 1989 . 
scientists tells us that at least 5,000 Canadians die prematurely each year from the effects of poor air quality . 
the Chinese government ' s focus on stability will continue to be given a higher priority than structural reforms of the Chinese political and legal system . 
however , should the Public Interest Commissioner who is dealing with a case of wrongdoing determine that he or she is not receiving satisfactory response at the agency or departmental level , he or she would be able to approach the minister , who is , ultimately , accountable , and the minister would attend to the rectification of the problem . 
i ask the question simply because there is a possibility , perhaps even a likelihood , that Parliament , which obviously includes the Senate , will be involved . 
in 1989 , an all - party resolution was passed by the House of Commons calling for the eradication of child poverty by the year 2000 . 
as for gathering berries , they have always taken me to the places where the best berries are to be found . 
but these treaties are not part of the description or the philosophy of an important treaty .

every political party had an input and made recommendations to the minister . 
the answers may only be found by opening the causeway gates for a significant trial period so that scientists can determine the best way for long term action . 
Mr. Speaker , my question for the member from the Reform Party will be brief . 
the night was what it was , and I challenge the members opposite to say otherwise . 
we had talked about it .

we can express concern in the meantime , but we are not allowed to enter into the negotiations in the meantime . 
after violating the parliamentary rules last December in making their Bill C - 20 public , now we again have the Prime Minister making a mockery of democracy . 
madam Speaker , I am very pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by the member for Huron - Bruce in his original question raised in the House . 
it is to help parents who too often must make difficult choices between a job and benefits for their children . 
opposition members know full well that many of the job fund programs have gone into their ridings . 
Quebec is a different society , and we are also different in our understanding of the financing of political parties . 
if the justice minister really wanted to change the law she could do so in one day with the co - operation of the House . 
it was over that very issue . 
it has happened before , and we must learn from past mistakes . 
since 1993 , the government has slashed funds to education by $ 6 billion . 
an actual financial analysis of the treaty has now been completed and it places the cost at approximately $ 1.3 billion . 
the public was excluded other than through this formal committee . 
they are tying up railway crossings for a much longer period of time than is allowed for in the rules . 
when will the Prime Minister stop abusing and running down our military and start giving them the funding they need to do the job ? 
the Liberal government is displaying an attitude of openness and sharing , two values that are part of our history and our sense of hospitality . 
it was politically impotent . 
senator Sparrow : 
in my view , extending parental care is in a small way showing that we do value our children and their caregivers . 
this limit will enable shareholders to better monitor the performance of management , while at the same time limiting the risk of a foreign takeover . 
we have a health care system in Canada that is by far the best in the world , but we have to be vigilant .

the problem is that the cash has been cut and all we know is that the government is preparing to put in a one time only payment .

yes , today is the sixth anniversary of the Liberals taking office . 
the point is that all kinds of occupations now have self - employed contract employees . 
they , like Roderick Webb , keep our democracy alive . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier 
here we have a situation in which provinces and territories are listed . 
what struck me , and I am sure struck others who were at committee , was a recurring theme , an opinion repeated time and time again , to the point where we had to take it seriously . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
motion No. 170 
the ban by Treasury Board has been established . 
if this 10 % rule should be thrown out the window , so to speak , then the government would have the opportunity under regulatory powers to increase foreign ownership and in essence turn over an additional percentage of Air Canada - our national airline , or at least it once was , which had a huge amount of taxpayers ' dollars in it - to another company outside Canada . 
i would like the member to comment on this . 
No. 
the point of order raised by the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot is a very strict reading of Standing Order 43 . 
it would create , in my opinion , radically different voting trends in the country because the first past the post system discriminates against every party in different regions of the country , including the governing Liberals in western Canada . 
British Columbia agreed to provide lands for reserves and the Government of B.C. considered the land question to be resolved .

in Part 5 of the bill , honourable senators will find a regime of liability for the carriage of goods , transferred here from the Carriage of Goods by Water Act . 
the government ' s idea of an environmental partnership is a prison cell and a pair of handcuffs . 
my concern , and I believe it should be the concern of all of us , is whether Bill C - 9 and the agreement are the most appropriate vehicles to accomplish that goal . 
the Royal Prerogative is so pivotal that the 1931 Statute of Westminster declared that any United Kingdom ' s alterations to the royal succession , style and titles must be agreed to by the Parliaments of the Dominions , of which Canada was one . 
we are doing what we said we would do , which is to have a dialogue and make sure that we talk . 
as I stated earlier , Bill C - 23 maintains the clear distinction between married and unmarried relationships . 
Mr. Derek Lee 
it is the moment elected representatives and the appointees to the Senate receive the approval of the symbolic representative of Her Majesty .

the government has the obligation to heed the opinion of the House of Commons . 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais

first , will the government apologize to the people of Manitoba for this unfortunate incident ? 
i think of my predecessors for 50 years who were never confronted with this awful problem .

all those opposed will please say nay . 
one of the most devastating occurrences in the country today , particularly in some communities , is the issue of fetal alcohol syndrome . 
order , please . 
the francophone nature of their institution has thus become increasingly important in fulfilling the role of preserving and protecting that culture . 
programs that help to rehabilitate , supervise and control youth as they return to their communities help to protect the public because these programs help to prevent further crimes . 
this is a very remote area of British Columbia , with a very tiny population : the aboriginal and the even smaller non - aboriginal population . 
there is no typical homeless person , although we are too often tempted to lump them all in together without thinking . 
the time has come for the government to play hardball on behalf of Canadian farmers . 
taxation 
the drafters , I submit , have not remained faithful to the expressly written opinion of the court . 
of course , the government would increase taxes , buy the lawn sprinklers and distribute them to Canadians to put on their lawns . 
i intend to ask the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to have the commissioner of the RCMP appear and explain his force ' s actions on the Bre - X file . 
the Business Council on National Issues said in April 99 , and I quote : 
royal Assent Bill 
there are discussions among various parties and companies and I hope there will be a resolution to it . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne : 
why ? 
we are not talking about 37 files , but 367 . 
members 
on the issue of the work of the Senate , our objective today , on which I will comment under the next order of business , is to , as quickly as possible , see two committees of the Senate brought into existence - namely , the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications and the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs . 
farmers especially know darn well it will not solve the problem . 
agreed . 
i like my friends a lot , and the member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot has the same haircut as me . 
we think of the former transitional jobs fund and , more specifically today , the Canada jobs fund . 
we cannot agree with it . 
in combat operations , it is not that Canada is spending too little ; it is that other countries , including NATO leaders , are spending too much . 
heart AND STROKE MONTH 
i can tell the member that the report which appeared today about the Monsanto product is absolutely false . 
i knew organized crime was proliferating , but I did not know to what extent and in what high - tech way . 
motion No. 97 negatived 
some members today have indicated the problems of the American west . 
Mr. Speaker , I have consulted an official RCMP report entitled " Proposed reorganization of operating structure - C Division '' . 
i must advise the hon. member that pairing is a private affair between two members . 
on December 22 , 1967 , Pierre Elliott Trudeau declared that the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation . 
this sector , uncertain as to the scope and applications of the bill , was concerned that it would not be able to get its systems and procedures under way in time . 
why ? 
CHECHNYA 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
the next question is on Motion No. 312 . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 100 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
the crux of the debate today is whether or not people believe this treaty will work to the benefit of everyone involved , not just the Nisga ' a but everybody . 
motions Nos. 199 , 200 and 201 
i am afraid that , once again , the federal government is not listening to Quebec ' s will and putting it in a yoke . 
Ms. Val Meredith 
i learned about Senator Balfour indirectly from the good works that had been left by him . 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
it was not difficult and not overly costly . 
could the minister tell the House whether there will be any new money for any of these programs ? 
the main point is that it is an example of something that makes our system fair . 
the petitioners call on the Government of Canada to immediately change the law so that people who are not genuine refugees would be sent home without delay . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
when that much money is taken out it has a huge and devastating impact on what happens . 
( division 114 ) 
we are being criticized for allegedly interfering in the referendum process of the PQ government . 
i assume he has stayed here ever since , but I have not been here the whole time . 
i can understand being in a country where you do not know the local construction trades , but this is nothing new to Foreign Affairs . 
the problem is , they are doing it on their own with no help at all from DFO officials . 
when we go abroad that is exactly what we do . 
that Bill C - 6 be amended by deleting Clause 72 . 
members 
i cannot see how anyone in Quebec or in any other part of the country could object to that . 
Mr. Speaker , we have learned that Andr é Juneau , of the National Battlefields Commission , received compensation from that organization for a donation he made to the Liberal Party of Canada at a fundraising cocktail . 
in so many issues we just really want a cure . 
in their first term the Liberals introduced legislation aimed at allowing companies to propose more cost effective ways of complying with regulatory requirements . 
we are doing our job . 
is there unanimous consent ? 
the programming that is available in a youth facility is often the more appropriate one . 
it is difficult for parents to contemplate leaving welfare , where services may also be part of their support for their children , to take a low paying job . 
Tuesday , November 2 , 1999 
recently , the supreme court had occasion to warn the public and the Liberal government in particular about overreliance on jail sentences as a means of reducing crime - related problems . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 105 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
members 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the second time ? 
the third report of the committee sought to put itself in a position to offer an in camera session , if it appeared necessary , to properly investigate the question of privilege . 
there is nothing in the announcement that refers to a buy - out program or anything of that nature . 
- provincial laws cannot limit an ancestral right , even if public interest is claimed . 
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
we remember him . 
* * * 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
it was like a tale out of Edgar Allan Poe : " Once upon a midnight dreary , as I pondered weak and weary ... " 
madam Speaker , I am very pleased to speak to this piece of very important and timely legislation , one that has obviously raised emotions on all sides of this debate . 
we are truly privileged to live in the best country in the world . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
agreed . 
i think what we have to do now is work toward ensuring that the aboriginal community can exercise that treaty right toward a long term plan . 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
every single penny that I spent on those things was deductible as a practice expense . 
every one of them has heard the message from British Columbians that this is such an important deal for British Columbia that it should be subjected to a referendum of the people , not just the Nisga ' a but the non - natives as well . 
there can be no point of order on this ruling . 
* * * 
we said that no longer would there be second - or third - class Canadians . 
my question is , giving approval to this - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
it is a compendium of 68 different federal laws which are changed as a result of this bill . 
Mr. Manley , the Minister of Industry , who had carriage of this bill in the other place , believes that he has met the concerns that were expressed by virtue of an amendment that he presented on October 15 , I believe it was . 
Mr. Monte Solberg 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
these amendments are necessary because currently we do not have an electoral system which is totally transparent in terms of those people , companies or organizations which donate amounts of over $ 100 to political campaigns . 
for three days there were no comments . 
the issue of grants in lieu of taxes goes back many years . 
i asked for notice of questions when we concluded on Thursday last , and I have received none . 
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) : 
the government could help immediately by beginning to lower the taxes on fuel . 
what we are trying to do is create a healthy and vibrant economy and allow people choices , so that if a particular job disappears because of commercial activity , then they will have an opportunity to seek other employment . 
members 
recently a CSIS agent was actually brought to task , but the CSIS director was completely untouched and , it appears , was complicit in the act itself and in the cover - up . 
it would become a job . 
equal pay for equal work is a concept we accept . 
referred to Committee 
that is a very important fact when we talk of democracy . 
when the item was last debated the hon. member for Leeds - Grenville proposed amendments to Motions Nos. 90 , 94 and 123 . 
Mr. Monte Solberg 
in recent days , the Secretary - General has condemned the United Nations for its failure with respect to Srebrenica . 
Canadians understood that large deficits and an astronomical debt would cripple Canada for generations to come if we did not act , and act we did . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
at present , everyone in the community , including municipal councils and chambers of commerce , is opposed to such a change . 
honourable senators , I will not ask the Leader of the Government a question about yesterday ' s Martin budget . 
i wish at this time to give full credit to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade for their assistance to Kenex in getting this matter resolved with a positive outcome for this young and enterprising business . 
Mr. Speaker , I request through your good graces that you use your office to facilitate the settlement of a difficulty which is disrupting the work of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri - Food . 
maybe that parliament would make a wise decision . 
committees OF THE HOUSE 
we must remember that the federal government does not hold all the levers of social policy . 
i hope we look at this issue again , when presumably the Privacy Act , under pressure from this committee , comes back before the committee within the next few months . 
and more , the principle of clarity is at the core of the democratic principle . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the minister responsible for homelessness if she thinks we will face another winter of deaths on the streets because of a lack of action by her government on housing . 
every year one way in which Family Service Canada draws attention to the needs , achievements and diversities of Canadian families is through National Family Week . 
why do they have that power ? 
gasoline PRICES 
why is the government promoting the Nisga ' a treaty that abolishes equal opportunity for all Canadians ? 
i did not have the privilege of knowing Mr. Webb personally , but I know the high regard held for him by members of his community of Norwood and throughout the riding . 
the provinces were not involved in appointing the members of the governing council , which is said to be temporary and will become permanent . 
the deficit is gone . 
Mr. Speaker , at the beginning of the week , the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced that the Montreal urban police were to meet yesterday with officials from Canadian Heritage and Revenue Canada . 
Mr. Maurice Godin : 
he said " From a very careful reading of Bill C - 54 , in my opinion , this would mean a significant step backwards for Quebec '' . 
Mr. Denis Paradis ( Brome - Missisquoi , Lib . ) : 
even an Associate Professor of Political Science and a specialist in this area appeared before the committee in support of our amendment , describing it as the minimum . 
the last sentence is quite firm . 
in that order of reference we find exactly the same wording , that is , that papers and evidence received and taken on the subject and work accomplished by the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs during the first session of the Thirty - sixth Parliament ought to be referred to the committee . 
with the guidance of the federal government , we will work together and achieve our goals . 
the court affirms that such were the position and the views of the crown . 
the payment of grants in lieu of taxes is a very good program but every once in a while a dispute arises . 
ever since , she has been saying that she would change the Young Offenders Act in a timely fashion . 
Mr. Speaker , once again in the area of justice we are going to play the spoiler role , because this bill is completely unacceptable . 
members 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy 
i think that it walked away from a prime opportunity to show the province of Quebec that it would be much better to remain in Canada and that in working with other provinces Quebec could achieve the best that is possible for that province . 
Mr. Speaker , the member ' s comments illustrate what is wrong with the government . 
honourable senators , there is no doubt that there is a farm crisis . 
i know the matter has been discussed by Speaker Molgat ' s advisory committee , but I think that the usages and practices of this place are quite clear . 
it is unfortunate that we have so little time this morning to address this subject . 
the number in the act was 50 . 
prior to 1988 our trade with the Americans was around $ 88 billion each and every year . 
however , countries such as the United States , the European Community and Japan have not yet fulfilled theirs . 
the very members claiming there was no consultation are saying that the Barreau du Qu é bec was consulted along with the Chambre des notaires . 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
he speaks of the nine million Canadians who live in rural Canada . 
therefore , when the POPS treaty delegates meet next March in Bonn , the minister should be prepared to have the Canadian model ready for scrutiny . 
that Bill C - 6 be amended by deleting Clause 44 . 
we are on the verge of the 21 st century ; that is an undeniable fact . 
i specifically asked the government about its intentions with respect to Bill C - 80 , which was legislation tabled in parliament last spring but not dealt with before the summer recess . 
the one thing that identifies us as human beings and not animals in our conflicts is that we resolve our conflicts by the law . 
it is just how it does business . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like you to call for a quorum .

please help our farmers . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Mr. Paul Forseth 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this supply motion today . 
let us look at the lack of accountability at the federal and provincial levels . 
it is because the governing party likes big parties . 
national Defence 
before I conclude , there is another aspect of the report we cannot let go without comment : the delicate issue of environmental standards . 
motion No. 356 negatived 
scientific studies to this point have not indicated that depleted uranium and illnesses including cancer are in fact related . 
these Canadians are concerned that the Criminal Code of Canada makes it too easy for people , who have been convicted of serious crimes , such as murder , attempted murder , sexual assault and manslaughter involving imprisonment greater than five years , to obtain release from custody pending the hearing of their appeal . 
had the member spent more time in committee he would have known that the committee debated all the issues he talked about . 
therefore , there is a delicate balance of encouraging these groups while not making them the spokespersons for the issue of religious freedom totally in China . 
they request that parliament insist to maintain the time honoured rules of common law and the criminal code and uphold the rights of parents to discipline their children by use of physical force that does not exceed reasonable limits under the circumstances . 
concurrence in Vote 6 a - Finance 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
thus another reason for not supporting the bill is that even if it were possible to adopt this kind legislation its value as an instrument to comfort those who fear they have been affected is certainly less than adequate . 
agreed . 
notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Engage Services 
just wait to know what it is about . 
Mr. Speaker , last week , the Canadian HIV / AIDS Legal Network released a report on injection drug users and the spread of HIV / AIDS . 
inmates refer to William Head as Club Fed. 
later , I will find the time to table in this house an extensive report that was prepared on politics and women ' s insights . 
bill C - 368 . 
we know that many coming from outside the country are from very tumultuous and sometimes wartorn backgrounds . 
that is not to say that this was achieved without sacrifice and dislocation . 
those more important ends for us are social and moral in nature .

the low dollar is a double - edged sword . 
Mr Speaker , I can tell from the expression on the face of the solicitor general that he does not have a clue about the new elections act . 
very often , young criminals are economically disadvantaged , they are less educated and are not too well informed . 
Mr. Speaker , when my hon. colleague from British Columbia speaks , it is always very interesting to hear what he has to say . 
once it has eliminated the competitor , the carrier restores higher prices . 
in fact , it is so bad that in the small town of Birtle , Manitoba , the chamber of commerce had to hire a night security guard to patrol the main street of the community , believe it or not , because there was so much vandalism . 
Mr. Paul Bonwick : 
it is a cinch ; international trade agreements are not listed as important treaties , by tradition . 
hopefully the minister in the fine efforts he made in the week since has brought some resolution to it . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :

then we have the other Black . 
at the same time as we have cut taxes in each and every budget , we have made strategic investments in the things that are going to make us strong in the 21 st century . 
why does the government not sell off the property , that taxpayer asset , and give the money back to taxpayer programs or give taxpayers a long awaited tax break ? 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister again . 
since , as I have said , that information is not in my possession , I do not know exactly what form it is in , but I will certainly provide information in as complete a manner as possible . 
this is not the government ' s money . 
because my brother is not in a sexual relation with my father , he will not be able to benefit from these measures .

hon. No ë l A . Kinsella ( Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this bill amends the criminal code to allow the next of kin to wear war decorations appropriately .

agreed . 
the throne speech set out a global strategy to build a better quality of life for all Canadians and to implement policies that make a difference in the lives of individual Canadians . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
i feel that it is a good bill as it indirectly brings light to the lack of funding from the federal government for matters of public safety . 
that has been borne out by some of the things we have seen over the past year where even the refugee determination system has determined that many people making claims are not genuine refugees . 
it is hardly fair to mechanics , who are self - employed or employed by someone else , to have to provide their own tools .

the effectiveness of our consultations with Canadians can be measured in terms of the enunciation of Canada ' s overall negotiating objectives and priorities . 
how about Clyde Wells , the embrace - and I am not familiar with the habits of the Prime Minister - but yes I agree with the hon. member . 
these assignments are funded internally within the RCMP ' s budget . 
senators from both sides of the floor have spoken to the issue , and I think we have demonstrated clearly that it is not a partisan issue . 
some hon. members : 
for months now we have seen misuse and abuse of these public moneys for political purposes in the Prime Minister ' s riding , and now we find the HRD minister had a cool half million given to her riding even though she could not meet the criteria . 
as we can see and hear , it is at the request of the Bloc Quebecois as well as of my constituents . 
Mr. Speaker , the comments by the Prime Minister of this country are very distressing . 
one of the most detrimental aspects of this bill is the control of the activities of third parties during election campaigns .

aboriginal people have a right to live as full citizens in this nation . 
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :

the member knows that as well . 
we have to put forward this legislation because the choice the people of Quebec would have to make for the third time in 20 years is fundamental . 
let us take a look . 
this is a very important issue in terms of the kind of roles the provinces and the federal government play in areas like tourism . 
yet , 160,000 people sent the Prime Minister a postcard asking for a new shipbuilding policy . 
nevertheless , this points to the necessity for clarification of what I think is an extremely important principle .

we have given all assurances that in order to achieve our objective of helping in this nuclear disarmament , we will also make sure that the safety and security of Canadians are protected as well . 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to answer the member ' s question . 
he has only a couple of words left to say , so could you - 
i am sure he was pleased , as were many Nova Scotians , to hear yesterday , and again this morning , reports of conversations between officials in the Orkney Islands and the Port of Halifax .

it is tempted by the lure of tax cuts , peddled by business elites without offering any real help to low and moderate income families . 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
i should like to have clarification on the procedure and the process that we are being asked to follow . 
in Canada , this initiative has received strong support . 
introduction and first reading 
hon. Roch Bolduc : 
my thanks to the Bloc Quebecois for this new and improved position .

we know that failure by this government to consult the provinces in a meaningful way during the negotiations of the NAFTA have resulted in a situation where bulk water that is located entirely within provincial boundaries could come under the NAFTA rules in certain circumstances . 
address in Reply - Motion for Termination of Debate on Eighth Sitting Day - Order Withdrawn 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
hon. Dan Hays ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
the government says that a few people negotiated it behind closed doors and the 301 members of parliament are just window dressing . 
that the House do now proceed to orders of the day . 
if the House would like , I would be happy to repeat it . 
i hope that - contrary to its habit - the federal government will show some fairness and will give a little bit more , or at the very least their fair share to Quebec and other provinces where research is being carried out . 
without an ethical screen our pension funds will wind up in the hands big tobacco . 
what have the minister and his negotiator been doing in the months since the Marshall decision ? 
under the NAFTA and the provisions of the WTO , in the future more rights will be given to corporations to overrule the decisions of duly elected representatives of parliaments and legislatures . 
their spending can be watched by the Canadian people . 
i am sure there was no absolute prohibition , neither in Sudan nor in any number of countries where we are not in agreement with the human rights policies of the local government . 
Mr. Speaker , again this week we saw the broad base support of Canadians everywhere for tough gun control laws and responsible gun use . 
in New Brunswick during the Liberal regime of the McKenna and Th é riault governments they slashed over 600 hospital worker jobs during their 10 year reign in New Brunswick . 
health SYSTEM 
when I left with my seat , I did not tell my party what I was going to do , because I wanted to show members of this House that this was a non - partisan issue . 
hon. Lyle Vanclief 
1 ) Reduce or eliminate all indirect and direct taxes from all farm inputs , i . e . , fuel , fertilizer , machinery , etc. 
we do not believe that is a proper use of taxpayers ' money . 
this section legislated that in the event of a mine shutdown or sale the government had to do everything in its power to mitigate the effects on miners and their families . 
the NDP representative did not seem too clear in his answers to such questions as cost to the taxpayers and the description of the type of government that would be controlling the reserves . 
i am glad we finally did it . 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
agreed . 
others invested in restaurants and bought shares in a private hospital . 
immigration ACT 
senator Boudreau : 
we believe that we are helping young people by investing in them when they are having problems with the law . 
human RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
in the mid - term let us rethink government involvement in agriculture . 
we are , however , in a position to deal with this matter now . 
they feel abandoned by the banks and deserted by their federal government . 
there is much that can be said on the issue , but my time is coming to an end . 
( a ) substituting the following for the proposed substituted text contained in paragraph ( a ) of the motion : 
Mr. Speaker , this afternoon , Gilles K è gle , a remarkable resident of my riding of Qu é bec , will become a member of the Order of Canada . 
i understand as well why they made signs to their leader when he came in to put the gag on us . 
when the government could not find suitable pro - treaty people to appear before the committee in some of the smaller cities , it flew them in from Vancouver and Victoria to appear before the committee because it had to stack it . 
( c ) give advice to the Parliamentary Librarian regarding the collection of the Library and acquisitions to enrich its cultural holdings ; and 
i worked for many years , as did a number of members of the House , fighting against apartheid . 
i cannot think of another profession where the level of satisfaction is so low . 
or he could try out the audience in L é vis . 
that leaves only about $ 1.7 billion over the next three years . 
it has called this legislation a priority yet it has refused to acknowledge how it is going to pay for this when it is already not living up to the monetary commitments under the old young offenders act . 
nobody is denying that . 
we will know what to expect .

there is time now before us to address some of the faults in the legislation .

we can look at the interconnectedness which the Minister of Industry highlighted . 
if our northern neighbours in our own country are to affirm their specificity and develop a life for themselves which guarantees the preservation of their lifestyle , surely the member for Churchill River will agree with me that one of the best ways to ensure this is to ensure they have strong collaborative links with people of similar aspirations and backgrounds who are their real neighbours in the north .

it was this case that really opened my eyes to the tragedy of domestic violence . 
do you know what the answer is , Mr. Speaker ? 
some of them have apples on their desks , too . 
to argue , in some curious theory of responsible government , that somehow the checks and balances that this institution must exercise diminish our system of parliamentary democracy is , I think , an argument that goes in the wrong direction .

when the insurance industry has to spend billions of dollars , as it did in eastern Ontario after the ice storm , because of increasingly violent weather events , our GDP goes up . 
in fact , it does the exact opposite in many crucial ways . 
yes , that is two , but those are the two the hon. member should worry about . 
however , let us be very clear when we state that we approve of full and open debate in the Parliament of Canada and that we do not approve of closure on this bill or any other bill . 
in simple terms , this means that the constitutionalism principle requires that any government initiative respects the Constitution .

introduction and first reading 
rail TRANSPORTATION 
it is entitled House of Commons Procedure and Practice . 
why would Canadians be happy to have in their electoral system , which is supposed to be totally non - partisan , the Prime Minister appointing all of the 301 returning officers across the country ? 
and I can also say , Canada is not a democratic country when our government will allow third world conditions to exist on our first nation reserves . 
it is important for the public and Canadian citizens at large to understand those areas that the Reform Party has spoken to on many occasions and that other members of the House have spoken to .

we should have been discussing the 10 % rule , the notion of cabotage and all these types of issues during a period of time when we were less rushed and when we were in less of a crisis environment . 
we saw the problem with migrants . 
correctional SERVICE CANADA 
it is certainly my wish to see a wrong righted in that area as well . 
it makes me think that the members of this House who are advocating this have given up on the idea of rehabilitation and that incarceration of young offenders is dealing more with retribution than with any hope of rehabilitation . 
it is not up to people in Ottawa to settle these issues once and for all .

following sentencing for a designated offence , military judges will thus be authorized to order the collecting of samples of bodily substances from persons who are subject to the Code of Service Discipline . 
senator Hays : 
every individual member of the House may have individual thoughts on that , but first nations are protected under the constitution and we deal with first nations on a nation to nation basis . 
i would gladly support statutory regulations that prevent us from going into social deficits and from going into environmental deficits as well because that is where we have some very serious problems . 
consequently , it would not do justice to Motion No. 1 to consider it as part of a group that includes amendments on contributions , expenses and reimbursements , since it does not deal with any of these issues . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
restructuring of Reserve Units in Atlantic Canada - Plight of the 1 st Field Regiment of the Royal Canadian Artillery

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to speak to a piece of legislation that perhaps is not quite as sexy and certainly not as controversial as a lot of the legislation that comes before the House . 
either Parliament has a legitimate role to play or it has not .

( 1950 ) 
we will do that . 
rather , we must show Canadians that the government is aware that things change and it is keeping an open mind . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
the hon. member quoted Robert Burns . 
in August 1992 , the impact of the charter on the Canadian Human Rights Act was confirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Haig v Canada . 
there is no propaganda when we talk about the beauty of our country from coast to coast to coast , helping small businesses grow , bringing about employment and capturing the market . 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
nay . 
there were other posters with a shovel and a Yes , suggesting that if we voted yes , we would have much more money in our pockets , and yet other posters suggesting that there would be many more jobs .

woe to them . 
the difficulty itself is a very complex one . 
this brings to mind another problem that we have with this whole process . 
the recorded division on Motion No 64 stands deferred . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
in a 9 to 0 decision , the Supreme Court corrected this by stating that when the Constitution speaks clearly and precisely , it is imperative . 
we have the solution for marketing grain on the prairies . 
Mr. Speaker , following the introduction by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs of a bill denying the fundamental rights of Quebecers , I ask for unanimous consent to table a document for the information of the House . 
free trade with the United States and NAFTA were and are the centrepieces of our many achievements . 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott 
there are some people in the country who believe that if the Reform Party were ever fortunate enough to lead the country that it would take section 35 out of the constitution . 
there are two opposite ways of seeing things , the federal government ' s way and the Government of Quebec ' s way . 
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
even if the provinces were able to come up with a great deal more money , AIDA is a demonstratively flawed program . 
we might ask how a government would go about affecting work patterns . 
it just does not exist . 
and more than five members having risen : 
Mr. Speaker , I have here a text that our colleagues across the way cannot object to , particularly my seatmate , the government House leader and member for Glengarry - Prescott - Russell . 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson 
is it the federal government ? 
some hon. members : 
this is how the aboriginals capture their fish live . 
( the House divided on Motion No. 103 , which was negatived on the following division : ) 
as a government we will respond to the human situation wherever that occurs .

i certainly acknowledge the root cause of the motion and appreciate his attempts to address that . 
Mr. Jim Hart : 
but if the Americans build ships , it is because they get help from their government . 
where are the Liberals ?

let us give generously during its fundraising campaign . 
i have to ask , is it not ironic that the other place , the Senate of Canada , is not available to Canadians through the medium known as television ? 
the Chief Elections Officer of Ontario has challenged the need for blackout provisions .

to safeguard the information in the Register of Electors , Elections Canada , from the time the Register was created , put in place sophisticated security monitoring systems ( both human and technical ) and well - documented data handling and processing procedures . 
i found that profoundly unfair . 
of the 45 state laws currently in place , some apply only to abortion while others apply to additional procedures . 
as we know from some of the briefs , 60 % of the things that are being done in health care , as we speak , have never been subjected to any sort of evidence based practice . 
we have given them that - 
we will do more . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer 
i chose that as my topic because I came across an invidious case of citizenship . 
however , what we see in the country today is that it is turned upside down . 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member referred to clarity . 
why have they done so ? 
let us put the rural communities together and the urban communities together . 
it is not an easy issue for all of us . 
let me conclude my remarks with these comments . 
some hon. members : 
prior to the 1989 convention , a child under international law was considered an object to be given care and protection . 
it is probably acceptable in most circumstances but I would ask hon. members to stay away from very strong language today . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
that being said , we have just received the ruling today . 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
i want to thank the hon. member for Lakeland for putting forward Motion No. 20 . 
once we start creating a bureaucracy , more and more of the money intended to help people ends up going to drive this great bureaucracy .

i would love to table the letter that he sent to the department asking for funding for MacPherson ' s Trailer Services and the one for the brewery in his constituency . 
he is on a very good health program . 
in the short term I guess we have to prop up Canadian agriculture with a subsidy , cash in hand . 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
prayers 
Mr. Speaker , I have said publicly many times that the question has to be clear and the result has to be clear . 
that would be nothing short of catastrophic . 
the government has no intention of listening to Canadians affected by the Nisga ' a treaty . 
these types of comments do not help in our question period or in our debates . 
when my parents were growing up , the question of bilingualism and biculturalism was not even on the horizon . 
that Bill C - 9 , in Clause 2 , be amended by deleting lines 34 to 37 on page 2 . 
the article also went on to say that arts education by focusing on the creative process prepares our youth for the highly skilled jobs that our country requires and will require in the future . 
for those members who do not know about Vimy House , it is a facility that stores a large number of national war treasures that are not able to be displayed at the Canadian War Museum . 
the minister has a lot to say , I see . 
well , honourable senators , if it turns out , some months or years down the road , that there were lurking , in the many provisions contained in Parts 2 to 5 , problems that no one had identified or foreseen , then the government and Parliament will look like complete fools when people look back and see and track the progress of this bill first through the cabinet and then the legislative process . 
it is not about extra money . 
the Quebec experience in this field is worth looking at . 
we think it is time for the government to either wake up or get out of the way and let another group govern that is going to listen to people , be accountable and make the changes necessary to put the country on the right track . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs , pursuant to notice of November 18 , 1999 , moved : 
in an interview with Le Devoir , when he was no longer Minister of Human Resources Development , he did not hold back from commenting on the situation at Emploi - Qu é bec and from boasting of his extraordinary talents and effective management . 
CIBC will provide a $ 200 million upfront payment to Air Canada to deepen and extend its agreement . 
we have heard some people say that to live in Cape Breton simply meant that when people got to the right age they got on the bus and went to Toronto . 
let us paint our old thrashing machines , do all this fancy - dancy stuff , put up a nice little museum in the name of the Government of Canada , the Liberal Party - we might even put the Prime Minister ' s name on it - and the dollars will flow , especially if we send the heritage minister out there . 
those who do not feel very strongly might just not bother . 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
some hon. members : 
this motion says - 
what we do not agree with is just exactly what is going on with the so - called democracy in this place . 
Mr. Speaker , this week the Ontario College of Family Physicians and the Canadian Environmental Law Association released a damning report on the effects of pesticides on Canadian children . 
when the employer is the government , its access to legal advice and assistance is endless . 
hon. Michael A . Meighen :

we congratulate and salute the Town of Lunenburg , Mayor Laurence Mawhinney and councillors , her shipwrights , marine blacksmiths , sailmakers and hospitable townsfolk . 
No. 
honourable senators , I cannot confirm that press item at this time . 
through the NCB , provinces and territories are reinvesting in complementary services for children and eight provinces have already invested in child care . 
members of my constituency , people that I represent here in the House of Commons , including the chief , his band council and other people from his community that I worked very hard with on this particular issue had to sit and listen to the comments from the members opposite . 
perhaps we will hear it later and that would be good news , but I am not holding my breath that the parliamentary secretary will get up in his place and say that the Canadian government is seeking a full , absolute and categorical carve out of public health care and education in this next round . 
he wanted to proceed in steps . 
while those with means can invest where they want to , the rest of us have to abide by that 20 % rule . 
health 
i felt it was important to show everyone that alternative lifestyle choices are in some respect mainstream , no big deal , or nothing to get upset about and that they crosscut every facet of social identities . 
is there not a standing order that would allow us to suspend the sitting temporarily ? 
could he table those results so that we can all examine them ? 
( division 701 ) 
perhaps I could prevail upon the honourable senator to repeat her concern . 
perhaps it was explained on the preceding page why it was desirable ; perhaps . 
this is the attitude of a man like Herb Grubel . 
if they do not match , the sometimes dying patients must turn quickly to other blood relations , bone marrow registries and pleas through the media . 
our focus must now shift from process to results to take the steps necessary to develop action items into specific deliverables in rural Canada and make concrete progress on the priorities of rural Canadians . 
i invite the minister to explain this very clear discrepancy . 
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) : 
honourable senators , if the Banking Committee is doing its job , it will be able to draw out any problem of the nature that honourable senators have raised in debate on Bill S - 3 .

hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 205 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( deduction of expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in employment ) . 
that is why we are simply asking for the withdrawal of Bill C - 6 , so we can go back to square one and put in place a more credible legislation . 
hundreds of businesses disproportionately located in the hometowns of Liberal cabinet ministers received government grants without anyone checking where the money went . 
starvation , cold and lack of electricity are endangering many people . 
minister Martin is going in the right direction , but it is very difficult figuring out when he will get there . 
honourable senators , I will not conceal the fact that this extended adjournment disturbs me considerably . 
the minister merely made public statements that in her legal determination the British Columbia Court of Appeal would uphold the constitutionality of the current law . 
it has always been present in research but , with its various foundations , is becoming more so . 
we will examine the proposal against the principles of the public system .

Mr. R é al M é nard : 
as per normal commercial practice for taxable corporations , Canada Post is permitted to wind - up Canada Post Holdings Limited so that these non - capital losses can be utilized as tax deductions by Canada Post Corporation rather than have them expire in Canada Post Holdings Limited . 
on behalf of the Reform Party , I encourage Mr. Khatami and the new government of Iran to pursue their stated course . 
agreed . 
in my speech , I will touch on three main elements of this bill on which we are criticizing the government . 
some hon. members : 
that ' s right , and you always got the right answer . 
six years ago , on September 23 , 1993 , The Globe and Mail reported Liberal Leader Jean Chr é tien as saying that a Liberal government would tell Bank of Canada Governor John Crow to pay greater attention to job creation and not be fixated on inflation . 
according to NATO , Canada is one of the countries investing less , in terms of its gross domestic product , in the missions . 
they should sell the house even though the market is depressed . 
we are skeptical about the European Monetary Union . 
the Reform Party is heir to the same tradition , a tradition that the united alternative , or CCRAP , or CRCAP , or whatever , seems to want to distance itself from .

we are prepared for any eventuality in terms of preserving the democratic principles that this country expounds .

Mr. Speaker , I am the minister who received the results of this audit . 
i am convinced that this was well planned and thought out by the federal government and that it is no coincidence . 
a negative vote on Motion No. 99 requires the question to be put on Motions Nos. 100 to 107 . 
we looked at the possibility of amending Bill C - 229 but learned that in order to make this an all inclusive bill would require passing amendments to either the criminal code or the Competition Act which would be outside the scope of this bill .

Mr. Speaker , a lot has been said tonight but we need to take a look at the motion itself and pull things into perspective . 
aboriginal AFFAIRS 
that Bill C - 9 , in the preamble , be amended by deleting lines 28 to 30 on page 1 . 
however in negotiations we ended up with an agreement that is workable . 
there is a tradition . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for his question and , in particular , his interest in the results of the ecological integrity panel . 
the new international instrument will evolve over time , building on the advice and consensus gained from ongoing dialogue , both here at home and abroad . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :

in Quebec , reform of the Young Offenders Act is quite simply not going over well . 
it is not affecting marriage whatsoever , whatsoever , whatsoever . 
Mr. Bernard Patry 
let me tell the members why . 
in 1890 they established their first land committee and in 1913 that committee sent a petition to the privy council in England seeking to resolve the land question . 
no wonder the Prime Minister does not want to talk about the WTO . 
Mr. Speaker , I was saying that in a civilized society , when a municipality develops an area or a street , or rebuilds infrastructures such as water or sewer pipes that are obsolete , blocked or broken , it is the abutting owners , that is the people living on either side of the street , who pay for such works . 
i am forced therefore to acknowledge that Bill C - 2 does not contribute to promoting the democratization of the electoral process . 
criminal Records Act 
we had a very long and detailed discussion to establish co - operation between China and Canada to tackle the problem of human smuggling . 
that Bill C - 2 , in Clause 24 , be amended by replacing line 13 on page 17 with the following : 
the less people , the less chance for accidents . 
that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples have the power to sit at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow , Thursday , March 23 , 2000 , even though the Senate may then be sitting , and that rule 95 ( 4 ) be suspended in relation thereto . 
the Speaker : 
we can really only look at whether they are evolving , and remember the historic importance of trade since time immemorial . 
division No. 328 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
there are two of them . 
will the finance minister commit today to investing in the best proven institution for children , the Canadian family , and permit the option of joint filing or income splitting for those Canadian families who choose to do so ? 
that was nothing short of a declaration of war on the family farm . 
this is only the fourth group that has ever led us in O Canada in our House .

the U.S. has indicated it is no longer interested . 
currently there is approximately 230,000 to 250,000 cubic metres of timber being harvested annually on what will be Nisga ' a land under the final agreement . 
no one knows better than the honourable senator who asked the question that this is a fundamental transition from an industrial economy relying on one employer to a post - industrial economy . 
the Chamber of Maritime Commerce spoke also about the advantages that labour practices and low labour rates give the shipbuilding industry in newly developed countries . 
national PARKS ACT 
second REPORT 
honourable senators , I am uncertain from the honourable senator ' s question whether she is suggesting that the requirement be placed on Statistics Canada forms .

for instance , the bill requires the question to be clear while we all know very well that the questions asked in previous referendums were very clear .

it is very important for everybody to know exactly what the rules are . 
Mr. Paul Szabo 
what Members say in the Chamber , however , is protected by privilege . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
what we have here is a very similar proposition . 
the potential for a meaningful contribution therefore has to come from co - operating with others . 
i am very aware of the whole concept of independent contractors . 
earlier , I referred to the hierarchy among international organizations . 
some of us who are opposed to this bill find it difficult to accept the lecturing that seems to go that if you are opposed to the bill you are somehow opposed to democracy . 
at committee stage , I will propose the appropriate amendment for clause 2 , with consequential amendments to follow . 
by virtue of that life experience , he could get to the heart of a problem and make an enormous contribution to the good governance of Canada through the Senate . 
the bumbling type of activity that led to this lost information , which increased the vulnerability of some of the operations that CSIS was pursuing , was bad enough , but then to have that error exaggerated further by the CSIS watchdog , SIRC , not receiving the information , to use the phraseology of the Minister of Justice , " in a timely fashion '' , but to read about it in the Globe and Mail , was absolutely abysmal . 
is that what the opposition objects to ? 
since access to the Internet requires a line and connection , is the minister not concerned that people in some areas will have to pay twice what others are paying to be hooked up to this technology ? 
we are certainly aware of their funding needs . 
and lastly , I would also like to table to the committee and these proceedings a copy of a letter dated November 1 , 1999 , that I received from the Secretary of State for the Status of Women , in which she acknowledges the legislative gap of native women ' s property rights , and in which she supports the government ' s position and belief that native women ' s rights will be addressed by First Nations communities . 
what is needed now is leadership from this government . 
in May of this year the court , in a two to one decision , responded to two questions on the reference by advising the minister that none of the new information presented to the minister would be admissible on appeal . 
appendices C 5 and C 6 list many hundreds of individual Nisga ' a , in fact all the Nisga ' a , who now have homes in four villages .

it said nothing in terms of extra assistance to farmers . 
that the motion be amended by inserting before the word " combat '' , the following : " effectively '' . 
honourable senators , today we say farewell to one of the finest and most dedicated parliamentarians it has been my privilege to know over the last 37 years . 
i remember distinctly talking to the customer service representative of the airlines . 
criminologists , social workers , police forces , legal experts , everyone is saying that the minister is headed in the wrong direction .

in fact , our task is basically to improve a system that has made our democracy a source of pride and international recognition .

the next question is on Motion No. 376 . 
he should rise in his place and denounce the Onex proposal , which will have a disastrous impact on a region such as ours . 
once the court has made a decision it cannot be reheard . 
in terms of moving out of the country , I think the Prime Minister put it very well when he talked about the environment and culture and everything else that makes us Canadian and the importance of holding on to this and not going after small gains in terms of dollars . 
as far as I have been able to gather , there have been no principled objections raised to Parts 2 to 5 , the electronic commerce parts of this bill . 
however , because there are two schools of thought , I wanted a greater degree of certitude , and thus I proceeded to give oral notice . 
it is simply improvising and reacting in a day to day way , as opposed to having some sort of concrete or deliberate path that it is following , giving Canadians the confidence they should have in their national government . 
given that this region is well represented in the existing network , Parks Canada is focusing its resources on creating new national parks in those regions that are not yet represented . 
i hope that all hon. members will be able to give this legislation their prompt and favourable attention . 
Mr. Speaker , I seek your guidance on this point of order . 
what has been harder to acknowledge and achieve is a balance in health research to ensure the particular differences and the needs of women and their bodies are taken into consideration . 
i do not understand how I could be refused unanimous consent even before I said what it is sought for . 
this has now become " This obscure clarity falling from Bill C - 20 '' . 
to Mr. Conrad , whom he is allegedly quoting , I suspect some person from his riding , I would say that in fact we did hear from these kinds of people . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad 
Cape Bretoners have been made economic refugees at the hands of the Liberal government .

let me conclude by repeating the most important fact . 
many of us want to know whether we should look at another means of achieving the extension of benefits , whether they be health , dental or other benefits . 
some hon. members : 
some have charged that the Nisga ' a final agreement creates a de facto third order of government that requires a constitutional amendment . 
nays 
i credit the media for this truth seeking exercise . 
honourable senators , it is clear that this is a shared jurisdiction . 
the hon. member did . 
we should therefore pay particular attention in the House to what B.C. MPs say on the matter . 
that is what the bill is all about . 
we said that the surplus would be divided 50:50 , 50 % for the debt and tax reduction and 50 % for social and economic programs . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the committee tabled its report in April and I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister of Health tabled the government ' s response to that report with the clerk earlier today . 
everyone will benefit from it .

people in the lower mainland tend to work far distances from their residences and therefore will have difficulty voting by 7 p.m. 
honourable senators , the minister dodged this issue in the other place . 
Mr. Eric Lowther 
in my address , I observed the following : 
Canadians wherever they live should be able to see their government at work . 
this is some formula coming from a Minister of Justice . 
that the papers and evidence received and taken on the subject and the work accomplished by the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs during the First Session of the Thirty - sixth Parliament be referred to the committee ; 
we believe in those principles , but what can a province do when its funds are being cut off and hospital costs are skyrocketing ? 
we leave it outside and stake it . 
he was using diplomatic language but I could easily crack his code . 
where the trade distortion adjustment program is particularly relevant is in the agricultural sector . 
" 20.1 Every eight years , the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development shall table in each House of Parliament a report on the state of the Nisga ' a Final Agreement . " 
the words " consideration of ethics " are completely inadequate . 
but guided by our values and our collective experience , we can ensure that Canada remains the best place in the world in which to live - the best place to raise children , to learn , to pursue opportunity , to share in rich , diverse and safe communities , and to admire the beauty of nature . 
some hon. members : 
it is also intended to introduce adjustment and restructuring measures for the West Coast salmon fishery . 
people who have applied under the current Citizenship Act will be made to meet the law set out in the new citizenship act when it is passed . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
members 
that is a good change . 
i heard the member for Vancouver West stand in his place and say that parliament makes the laws , the government enforces the laws and the courts interpret the laws . 
if that is the case , then I am more than prepared to vote in favour of sending the bill to committee for further study , if that is the wish of the Senate . 
referendums 
obviously the Competition Bureau will look at the operators to make sure they have enough facilities , that their facilities are safe and that they have enough resources to operate . 
that analysis yielded a number of suggestions and in some cases , conclusions which were included in the committee ' s nearly unanimous report .

he stated at page 12:7 : 
just as we happen to be about to begin discussing these provisions , here comes another gag order to stop us from doing so , to limit the time we will have for discussion , to ensure that the bill is pushed through , while there are still very legitimate concerns on the table which the government ought to respond to . 
Mr. Speaker , the decisions taken after the election were certainly not very helpful . 
there is no legal precedent by virtue of which a person is a victim of libel because that person ' s occupational group or the institution to which he or she belongs has been attacked publicly . 
we of course want to hear the question and common courtesy says that we then have the right to hear the answer . 
the terms and conditions are being dictated to them . 
it is that supposition that I would like to tackle during my time here today . 
motion No. 93 
does the Prime Minister agree with his caucus colleagues that he has failed farmers , or is this just another example of the Liberals saying one thing out west and doing a different thing here in Ottawa ? 
the hon. member should cross the floor and say thank you to the Prime Minister for the Liberal yes instead of the typical Tory no . 
my colleague was there and he agrees with me .
